The menu options including the wine menu were very limited for what seemingly should have been a great fine dining experience.  I ordered the 28 day aged ribeye.   It was extraordinarily salty....so much so that I had to stop eating it.  The waiters description of the potatoes accompanying the ribeye sounded very good.....layered potatoes and short ribs.  When it arrived it was a thinly sliced baked potato with a whole short rib on the plate next to the short rib.   Presentation of the dish was lackluster.   My bone in rib eye was cut from the bone and stacked in two pieces end on end. My wife ordered off the restaurant week menu....reasonably priced for 3 courses.  However her 3 courses were all disappointing.  The soup seemed dull and thrown together.  The main cod fish entree was ok.  The desert - a vanilla cake - was so hard and tasteless it could have been used as a hockey puck.  Overall this was a $400 waste of money.

Two downsides, one that is their fault, one that is mine:

2. I took my meal to eat in my parked car.

Have visited twice, and those visits were months apart.

Trip #1 had fried ravioli app that was quite good and pasta with shrimp that was not.  Way, way garlic heavy and runny, runny sauce.  Hubby had an average burger.  We both remembered it being loud, but we thought maybe still worth a second trip.

Trip #2 they first tried to seat us right in front of the guitar player.  Asked to move upstairs, and still way loud.  Ordered the same fried ravioli app - way overcooked and disappointing.  This time I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, marked as one of their specialties and they are all a pub after all.  Wrong.  Big mistake.  Horrible.  Their Shepherd's Pie is a base of browned meat with something red speckled in (maybe pimentos?), with a huge slab or potatoes that were not creamy, not hot, and not flavorful.  And a HUGE slab.  Beside that there was obviously microwaved broccoli still way chunky and microwaved baby carrots... both absolutely plain except for a brown canned gravy poured over everything.  Gross.  I ate like three bites and lost my appetite and shoved aside.  When the waitress asked if I wanted a box and I said no.... you'd think she'd inquire, right?  No, she did not.

Hubby had a burger that was good, but in his words Five Guys a few storefronts up is better.  His steak fries were also good.

I have this tradition when my mom comes to visit that I take her out to eat at a different restaurant each time. It's been over 6 years since I've come to the Main Line, and we haven't visited the same restaurant twice. Out of all of these restaurants, she said Plate was by far her favorite meal. I'd probably have to agree with her on that one!

Friday night I looked here on Yelp at Plate's reviews, so I was skeptic about having good food here. The reason I decided to go here in the first place was because I really liked the menu: come on, tomato bisque soup with mini grilled cheese? You can't find an easier way to my heart than through that dish. So naturally, I was upset to read that the service and food were not up to other peoples' standards.

Well, I will agree on the service. Our waitress was less than enthusiastic to wait on us, although we did our best to be sweet and kind to her. My mom and I split the calamari as an appetizer, and it was definitely enough for 3 people. We didn't get any of the oft-spoken-about bread and hummus spread, but I assumed that was because we got our appetizer pretty quickly. I try the calamari everywhere, and Plate's version was very good, crunchy, with a little spicy aftertaste. Paired with the lemon zest and the Asian vinaigrette, it was a great start to the meal!

Our waitress didn't actually bring out any of our dishes; instead, someone from the kitchen did --- which was actually more pleasant since they were kinder. For the main meal, I ordered the Capri Sandwich with fresh mozzarella, tomato, grilled eggplant, basil pesto, all on a French baguette. My mother ordered the Ahi Tuna Burrito with complimentary small sides of guacamole, black beans, sour cream, chipotle aioli, and pico de gallo salsa. We shared a side order of the famous baked mac & cheese. Both of our dishes were around $10 and there were at least 2 servings in each one.

My sandwich was so fresh and bright that I initially thought I could eat the whole thing. I wanted to, really! The fresh tomato and cheese were strong but not overpowering and the pesto added a nice garlic taste to the eggplant. I wish I could make one of these sandwiches taste so good when I made it, but I suppose that's the point of going to a comfort food restaurant -- they make it for you! In the end, I couldn't finish the whole sandwich, especially after tasting how orgasmic the mac & cheese was. Better than my mom's, for sure, and that's really saying something! Even she agreed that she preferred this mac to her own. 

My mom's burrito was different but still tasty. I'm not one for tuna, but she assured me that the flavors were smoky and Chipotle with fresh spices. I tried some of it without the tuna and it sure did have a smoky but not overwhelming flavor. We both asked for half of our meals wrapped up because we were so stuffed we couldn't finish them. I ended up reheating mine for dinner and it was just as tasty.

The ambiance was casual yet refined, nothing out of the ordinary for Ardmore and Suburban Square. While we dined, we saw clientele ranging from young families with 2-4 year old children, to grandmother-mother-daughter, to high-school girls going out for lunch. The bill came to $45-50 and we took home a grocery shopping bag full of leftovers. If you think that we're getting 2 lunches and 2 dinners out of it, that's about $12 per person... not bad for how good the taste was!! 

Definitely somewhere I'd go again for lunch with friends or family. I enjoyed the experience and don't know why everyone else is so unhappy with the restaurant.",2011-03-20 14:47:29,0.4911398,-0.46849388,-0.2638926

The food here is the best Chinese food I've had outside of the three months I spent in China. The Szechuan Beef in particular is amazing, with a crispy outside, and an amazing sauce garnished with hot peppers. The General Tso's Chicken has enough garlic to ruin the evening of your significant other, and huge hunks of ginger that compliment the crispy chicken perfectly. Even their pot stickers are done well, and they come with a great sweet and sour sauce and a mustard/horseradish mix that will blow your sinuses away.

There are a great many of us (I'm guessing roughly 20 staying at the hotel) and everyone enjoys the place.  There are some quirky details worth noting...

First that it had a name like ""Mendenhall Inn"" and seemed placed in kind of the middle of nowhere we were thinking it was some sort of historic B&B that was modernized into a boutique.  That's not the case.  This place is pretty much a recent installation through and through.  It might have a historic story but the buildings are on the newer side for this part of the country.  Which is also to say its very nice!  The floors don't creak, the water works, etc.

The free hot breakfast was a hoot!  I've never seen so many machine made munchables.  It was incredible!  There is not only the obligatory waffle maker and hot chocolate machine, there' s a pancake maker, an oatmeal maker, and more!  it was like Henry Ford had designed the breakfast bar.

There were also premade eggs, biscuits, sausage, and such under a warm light as well.  There seriously was a huge selection of things to eat and drink.  I'd say that's a plus for the place seeing how you won't have to get up and go somewhere for breakfast.  Just know that there's nobody there making mimosas for you. ;-)

The restaurant and bar really seemed like a different world all together.  Not sure if that's intended or not.  They have a pretty decent amount of regular local customers which is pretty impressive considering it is still listed as a hotel restaurant.  They must be doing something right.

We ordered room service once and it was good.  That's all.

The people working there really do make the place.  We allowed our little guys (cribs and extra blankets were no problem) to waddle up and down the halls and wander around as much as possible and they were always welcomed.  Even jumping on the lobby couch didn't cause a mean stare.  The staff had lots of suggestions for family friendly happenings which was much appreciated.

It was oddly dry for a place in PA.  Not sure what that was about.  They had no humidifiers or other solutions.  You've been warned.

Lastly, if you forgot your toothpaste, razor, Snickers bar, etc there's a little snack shop that should carry it but you'll be hard pressed to find that or a pint of ice cream worth eating.  Nobody wants pistachio!  Hopefully that thing gets restocked because with all the space they have in there they could be running a 7-11 depot out of it.

If the Mendenhall Inn were in 7th grade the teacher would say:

I've been to T3 five times and have eaten there on three occasions.  I've consistently had good food, though I struggle with the price for the value and portion size.  My most favorite foods there so far have been the fried tomatoes (on special), corn fritters, primal chili, crabcakes and blackened catfish.  Prices are too prohibitive on their charcoal menu offerings (with no sides?!?!) to entice me.  Service has always been quick and accomodating and all of my meals have always come out hot with the appropriate condiments.  Great bartending with special emphasis on liquor/cocktail knowledge AND food pairings.  I've never been bored with my bourbons there, and it never fails that I am offered something that I've not tried before.

The decor in the venue is simple yet interesting.  Whiskey barrels serve as seats and foundations for the tables and bar upstairs, though the hard bar seats are hell on the ass with little back support.  The lounge area has inviting couches, a fireplace and shuffleboard.  There's a distinct lack of scuzzy people hanging out and that's almost enough for me to give them an extra star!

Twisted Tail has become a hotspot in the Delaware Valley for blues performers.  House band Mikey Junior and the Stone Cold Blues Band (have competed several years at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis) rock the spot weekly and host the Open Jam on Sunday evenings.  Other local and regional acts have graced the stage, to include Roger Girke, Georgie Bonds and Deb Callahan.  My only whine is that acoustically, the band space is far from perfect. The narrow chamber limits the ability to get a substantial audience in to see the musicians; there are only two tables on the floor up in the front of the room.  The bands are backed by glass windows and surrounded by brick in the long, narrow room; sound vigorously jettisons around in the room.  It would be easy to put some stylish acoustic material in the clamshell where the bands play to control some of the harshness.

My other criticism?  My sense is that the chef and management is overthinking, coming close to ruining the simplicity of southern cooking with nouvelle techniques and ideas.  This isn't a BBQ joint an they should probably stop peddling themselves as such unless they truly change the menu and employ KISS priciples.  In turn, they'd be bringing in far more people and getting far better reviews with easier-to-deliver fare.",2012-02-03 04:58:24,0.3090226,0.34906012,0.1766497

We both ordered the special: Eggs Benedict with a crab cake. It came out in a timely fashion and with no issues. However the taste was just not impressive. Our english muffins were both burnt and the crab cake just didnt have a great taste to it. The potatoes on the side were very tasty and complimented the meal well. 

I will give the bar a strong kudos. She had bottomless mimosas and I just had a few pints. They had a very strong selection of both draft and bottles. And the mimosas were absolutely delicious. 

The manager was very nice and pleasent to us. However we did ask them to turn one of the TV's to the NFL playoff game and he never did. I dont think he was trying to ignore us on purpose but either way by the time we left the TV was never turned. And the restaurant was half full (or half empty depending on your outlook of life) so he wasnt too busy that he couldnt have done it.

In the end our bill was around $80. Which is on par for most brunches in the city with drinks. However we both walked away from the meal still hungry and looking for more.

The noodles were a little thinner than I remember them, but they're fresh, and that really makes all the difference. For those who don't know Taiwanese beef noodle soup, the broth is supposed to be mildly spicy and salty, with a modest amount of chili oil and a hint of star-anise.

We are from Connecticut so we hadn't really seen anything like it and we enjoyed ourselves a lot. We went on a Sunday early afternoon in May 2014.

I would say there are three groups of people on this boat.  People who came for the brunch buffet, people who came to learn about the area/pay attention to the tour, and those who came to lounge on a boat with drinks.  Whichever reason you're interested in it for-there's potential for a good time. 

I was on board for the tour part, we opted out of the brunch due to some mediocre reviews about it. I wanted to be able to see everything the tour guide was talking about. We were advised to board early to get a seat on the front left side--but there were plenty of seats even after everyone was aboard.  Even if you don't opt for the brunch there is still plenty of food you can buy at the bar/snack bar. I got a frozen margarita, that was pretty nice. 

We enjoyed the guided tour portion of the ride, learned a lot about the area (being Yankees, we knew absolutely nothing when we started) My mother especially liked the voice of the gentleman giving the tour over the loud speaker--she said it reminded her of Disney World. 

They play the calliope when its time to set sail. Try not to stand too close to it, its SUPER loud. I liked it a lot more when I was several blocks away in the French Quarter and the distance created a decibal buffer.

My first impression was this place is very cool for Belleville.  It's a nice date spot, for sure and it's doing a good business. Our friends wanted to sit in the patio area, which has a retractable roof (how cool is that).  Not much ambience there, though.  Wrought iron pub tables and plain wooded walls that kind of looked like plywood.  Anything, graffiti or whatever, would be an improvement to plain plywood.  Sorry, it my inner interior designer.  I'm watching too much HGTV.   The front/bar area was well decorated and quite nice, though.  If you're an ambience snob like me, sit up front.

Anyway, we ordered a Marguerite pizza and an Alsation pizza ( smoked bacon, Vermont crème fraiche, & caramelized onions with grated parmesan). Oh, I forgot, they were ""flatbreads"" not ""pizzas"" just to be clear.  If there is a difference, I don't know it.  These were wood-fired pizzas to my eye.   They were both good, if not spectacular.  The bacon was very sweet, which my wife didn't like at all, and the Marguerite had IMO too much cheese.   In December it might not be a bad idea to hide the tomatoes, though...

The wine list is huge, they also have 80 beers.  No complaints there.  Our server made a couple of great wine suggestions, but disappeared for what seemed like an hour.  We sat with empty glasses at least 20 minutes and the second round took forever to come out.

The chicken itself comes in two flavours: crispy deep fried with breading, and sweet & hot sauce. A bonus is that every order is lovingly deep fried into oblivion in seven minutes. So you're not getting some old ""re-fried"" leftovers (like McDonalds and their hash browns) and your chicken's going to be burning hot. YEAH!

Unfortunately, this is where I felt a bit let down...  the crispy version didn't that much taste to it. I guess it's so you can taste the chicken itself, but it was just wasn't particularly exciting, you know? I loved the texture of the breading though...mmm. 

Meanwhile, the hot & spicy chicken has a very strong hot pepper paste taste. I like cooking Korean food and love using hot pepper paste, but I don't like it when the whole thing tastes like nothing but hot pepper paste. The sauce just had too much of it and I couldn't taste anything else. 

This place could be kinda pricey at $22.99 for 10 pieces, as you only get one side to go with that, daikon or fries (nothing special). The chicken is supposed to be 100% hormone free and all that niceness, though, so that could also account for the higher price.  Lots of people do take-out but if you sit in, you can also ask for some tea. The restaurant's very spacious and clean. I also saw a lunch special for $7. 

Overall, I'm still looking for a good Korean Fried Chicken joint in Edmonton I can keep going back to, but I'll probably have to continue satisfying my cravings elsewhere (for now!).",2014-01-23 02:31:34,1.0751417,-0.90494066,0.4524182

I have never been to a wash that has a dryer. That's awesome. I like that there's a separate tire/wheel brush that has stiff bristles and the regular soft bristled one for washing. Huge number of settings on the dial; bug pre-wash, waxes, Rainex..... and everything takes a card even the vacuums!

Here's where we get to the sticky situation, the pricing signage is kinda vague. Vacuums are $3, but for how long? I had to swipe twice, so $6 there and couldn't have been more than 15 minutes use.

On to the wash, of which there are only 3 bays for self serve. Here it's a $5 minimum. I swipe and start scrubbing. I get a pre-wash, tires and wheels, and half the car soaped up when the machine asks for more money. I actually like this feature so I don't spend too much time and money here. 
So, second swipe. And I'm doing great! Finished soaping up, gave the floor mats a little rub with the brush and on to rinse. Uh oh, streaks. So now I've got the brush and rinse sprayer going together. Spray, scrub, spray. Keep moving. You've got to be getting close to ""times up"".

Ok, all swirls and streaks gone. Phew! Let's rinse and try this fancy hand held dryer. 

And we're done! Turn to the machine to see the time counting up, not down. Oh crap! Turn the knob to 'Off' and press the button above twice. Done! 
Nope still counting up. Frantically jab the button several times really hard. 18:15,18:16,18:17... I'm freakin out.

19:16, 19:17, 19:18... He comes and pushes the button once and the timer stops. 

Phew. That's weird but thank you. I guess an extra minute isn't too bad. How much could that be. But, strange that it didn't shut off like the first time. Well, $10-15 for a sparkling clean car, worth it I'd say. Car hasn't looked this good in months. 

So checking the bank for other things,  there it is a single $5 authorization for the wash. Ok, no worries. 
Checking the bank the next day? $31 for a car wash, that I did myself. And I did a fine job, but I certainly wasn't slow about it. I'm pretty sure I could pay less than that for someone else to do an even better job than I did. 

I think I need to speak to someone, hopefully there's somebody even there to speak with. I don't think the older gentleman had any authority. So we'll see

We were seated on the upper deck of the restaurant, which seemed to me like a cozy and private elevated area (loved the shag carpet), but later proved to be the land of forgotten patrons. Our waitress took the drink order promptly, and I was quite impressed with the customizable Bloody Mary menu. Anxiously awaiting the arrival of said beverages, my friends and I waited and waited on an order of drinks, which seemed par for the course in regards to the rest of the meal. Our waitress, though kind, was complicit in the slow service on which Jones appears to operate. I'm all for a leisurely brunch, but let's pick up the pace. As for the food, it was simply eh, which is incredibly disappointing when the banana maple walnut pancakes are advertised as though you'll never taste anything better. I would love to try Jones again for another meal, in part because I'm enthralled with the fact that it looks like a set of Mad Men, but I think I'd rather stick with diner food, which is a no doubt safer (and cheaper) bet.

Location:
The location couldn't be better. You're literally within minutes of all of the best on St. Pete Beach. There is a Walgreens (pharmacy) and a Publix (grocery store) literally across the street. There are numerous restaurants and bars within walking distance (depending on how hot & muggy it is). It was the beginning of August when my wife and I were here, so we drove everywhere - but there is a lot within walking distance..

Cleanliness:
Other than a minor musty smell that goes with any beach property in Florida during the summer, the room was clean and extremely comfortable. So comfortable in fact that my wife and I could not help but take 2 - 3 hour naps each day..

Noise Level:
We stayed here from Wednesday through Sunday. On the first 2 nights (Wed & Thur), it almost seemed as though there was no one else in the place - even though it was packed. It was extremely quiet. The only problem we had on the final 2 nights was the noise coming from the upstairs bedroom (running kid) and people playing dominoes on the picnic tables outside at midnight. But with the a/c on, we could barely hear the people playing dominoes - so I cranked up the air and blissfully went to sleep. If you get an upstairs bedroom, I could see there being NO noise problems at all..

Staff:
All of the staff that we encountered were wonderful; they were all nice, friendly and very accommodating. You would think that would be a given in the service industry, but as I'm sure all of you are aware, it isn't. The staff was very pleasant..

Price:
We were looking to make it a special trip and stay at the swanky place on the beach, but decided to spend the money on food and drinks instead, and we're glad we did. This place was half the price of the more swanky place down the street, but for what it was, we made the right choice. We may have stayed at the other place for an anniversary or other special occasion, but the Plaza was great for this vacation.

Overall:
As you can tell from the other sections, I'm a huge fan of the Plaza Beach Hotel - Beachfront Resort. If you're looking to save a little money but have a great trip, I would recommend this little gem. The pool is refreshing, the beach is just steps away and there is a tiki bar just past the pool on your way to the beach (or on your way to the pool from the beach). The staff at the tiki bar - although not Plaza Beach employees - are as equally as nice and friendly as the staff at the hotel. There are plenty of activities at the Plaza Beach Hotel, from shuffleboard to bean bag toss to grills where you can barbecue.

To start, getting a table for 5 on a Saturday at 8:30PM was pretty miserable.  We were told to ""check back every 10 minutes"" for a starting 45 minute wait.  After 45 minutes, we were told to ""check back every 5 minutes.""  Really?  Fine, food was awesome, we'll play your game (the live music venue beside them is awesome).  

We finally were seated, and ordered food.  It wasn't all bad, but it was definitely inconsistent and average at best.  Smoked salmon ravioli was completely saturated with dill, to the point of being one-note.  The gnocchetti sounded great on paper, but they forgot to put the panchetta, rendering the plate completely flavorless due to the lack of salt.  The duck in the duck pasta was completely overcooked to the point of nearly duck jerky.  The devils on horseback were soggy and overdone.  

A few standouts though were the sliders and the deviled eggs, and the cocktails were delicious.  Maybe their chef was in the weeds or they had the B-squad in on a saturday night.  Either way, unfortunately I won't be going back after this one.  a 5* and a 2* experience don't lend me to trying for the ""3rd time's a charm"" experience.  sigh.",2014-07-29 05:00:22,0.25978076,-0.9085116,-1.1063104

Let's start on positive side...
-the food. It's good. Maybe even really good (depending on the time/day). Almost great (at times).  I've had several of the burgers and they are usually good. I've had with bun, and as a wrap. Both good. BUT, if you get as a wrap, tell them to serve on a plate instead of the tray with paper. You start cutting into a juicy burger on paper and you end up eating a lot of paper. The fries are good, but they are hit or miss. 
-hard to find a hotel eatery that is this good. Normally they are substandard even for fast food standards. With that said, the fact that it's part of a hotel is one reason for the inconsistency in quality and the consistent issue with service. 

The not so good...
-service. It just isn't good. From bartenders who are more fixated on their fiends who are visiting to wait staff that are inattentive, absent minded, or untrained/unaware. If I could pick something they are consistent with, it's service issues. 
-the price. This place preys on being convenient for guests of the hotel. It's an expensive burger. The apps and sides are expensive. The beer is expensive. You get the drift. It's expensive. This makes the above item even more amplified. 

There are better alternatives to this place in the area. Unless you are at the hotel and just don't want to go anywhere, I'd try something else. If your stuck, patience and prepare to pay.

I do have to start by giving praises to the front desk clerk James Beard. We traveled from LA to Nashville on an overnight flight expecting my 18 month son would sleep on the 4 hour flight. Not. Upon arrival, we had a cranky baby and of course check in isn't until 4 pm but our flight arrived at 5 am. Well James helped get us an early check in when all seemed booked. Made our trip start looking brighter. The hotel condition...well let's just say the rate we paid (over 300 per night) is absurd for the condition of the room and quality of the in house dining (breakfast to be specific). The rooms are quite outdated and the beds seemed to sag on one side as if weight was only applied to one side (that was the case for both queens). We had the breakfast meal plan upon arriving and it was far from what we expected. Greasy omelette, raw sausage links and minimal selection. They did have the free amenities of coffee in the lobby but after staying in the San Diego site near Sea World, that bar was set pretty high and not to mention at least $150 cheaper. Glad to say we only spent one night here to cut our losses. Bright spot of staying here is it is about 2-3 blocks away from a few pretty good good spots but I think I'll take my chances elsewhere if there is a next time.

We were seated immediately and it wasn't too crowded. The music selection was varied but enjoyable albeit a little loud.

We were told by a local on our team that we needed to order the Rock-a-mole, which is Lucy's take on guacamole. There isn't any secret ingredient or anything but it was certainly good and being from the Austin/San Antonio area I know my guacamole. 

We also shared the serious nachos which were good but the cheese had cooled too much before we really got into eating them so it was hard to break apart and you often ended up with chip and not much (if any) cheese.

I ordered the Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel special which basically was fajitas and all the fixins and it was just okay. I paid extra and got the shrimp since I hardly am close enough to the gulf to get fresh shrimp but these weren't all that fresh and not all that tasty. (Maybe they had to ship them in with the oil spill taking away a lot of the fishing/shrimping business). I also thought that the shrimp would be in addition to the steak and chicken. It might have just been my misreading the menu but the way it was worded it was unclear.

Service is what really holds this place back though. It was not all that crowded since we were eating early so there really wasn't much reason for my drink glass to be empty for most of the night. Now that I'm thinking about it I don't think anyone even checked up on us to see if everything came out and tasted all right.

I didn't have the opportunity to shop around and that made me nervous. I remember seeing an advertisement for Jack Flash in my Parish Bulletin so I Googled, and what do you know, they had great reviews so I decided to give them a try. 

They seemed very busy (which is a good thing, in a way - people obviously trust them) - but Patrick came out asap for me. He came at around 4:30pm and we realized pretty quickly that my problem was going to be a puzzling one. He stayed on until about 7:30pm and said he would come back as soon as he could to resume troubleshooting. Knowing I had a big issue, he again freed up some time in his busy schedule to come see me, again after hours, the next night. He arrived at 5pm and he was finally able to solve my issue. He was at my house until 9:30pm working and working to restore my electricity. I was so happy with the service and the fact that he was willing to stay on until the job was done. Honestly, I was a little hesitant having him stay so late because I didn't want to be hit with some kind of an after hours or overtime charge, but at the same time, I really wanted my lights back. When I received my bill, however, I was extremely surprised at how reasonable it was for 7+ hours of labor, and it wasn't easy labor, either - I definitely wasn't charged for after hours. 

I will be calling them again in the spring to have some more big work done (this time preventative, so that I don't lose my lights again!).. They have my business!

UPDATE::

It took two years but I finally was able to get Jack Flash out a couple months back to replace my 100 AMP Panel and entrance cable. Again 5 stars.

Another Whole Foods was located about 2 minutes down Wynnewood Avenue. However, that location had horrible parking as it was shared with some local businesses like Sang Kee and Dakota Pizza. The location was also on the smaller side causing overcrowding. Also, it was a bit old. 

By moving to the new, bigger location they believed they were fixing those issues. They addressed the problem, head on, they fixed most but I am not sure they fixed them all. 

First, they built an indoor and outdoor parking lot. However, these are always packed and it is always a struggle to find a parking spot. When it is very crowded workers have to direct traffic. One time, a small fight broke out. The traffic pattern can be confusing as well. 

Other than that there are no real glaring issues about this location. Compared to the last location, this store is much bigger, cleaner and has a much better and healthier variety.

For example, the carts here are XL, a full size tavern and beer garden are downstairs and a juice and Smoothie bar is available. They have also expanded upon the salad bar, sushi bar, pizza kitchen and bakery.

Food wise, I absolutely love this stores hoagies. Their seasonal ""thanksgiving feast"" hoagie is off the charts. They have a somewhat ""healthy"" candy bar, which has amazing fruit snacks. Finally, their salad bar is delicious with so many options from types of lettuce, to dressing, to croutons, proteins and fruits and veggies. 

This location is also environmentally friendly as it uses as little energy as little. They have non-moving check-outs and they have large factory type lights, which use less energy altogether.

Cheese on Speedway evoked indelible childhood memories:  eating my very first piece of pepperoni pizza, sugar-fueled birthday parties with friends, and lots of Ms. Pacman.  Those same awkwardly creepy, soda-drenched, matted fur animatronic characters still performed for the birthday partiers.  Other than transitioning from '60s songs to '90s music, not much had changed in the last thirty years.  I guess it was time for an update, right across the street.

The good stuff:

The ""sticky"" factor is gone, since the tables, carpet and paint on the walls are brand new.   The well-lit dining area is rectangular with no tube running along the top, which makes it a lot easier to keep track of the kids.  Some new attractions have been added, including an elevated, life-size rocking-horse. Flat screen TVs have replaced Chuck E and the gang.

The ""meh"" stuff:

The only tables that seat more than four people are in the reserved area.  Unlike before, our group of 6 had to sit at separate tables.  The games are right next to the tables, so we had to shout to be heard over the clamor.  Chaos reigned on this Saturday afternoon, leaving my nerves jangling.  By the time we left, I had a raging headache...vowing never to return.  (I will.)

I forgot to see if the new location has beer or not.  What the hell was I thinking?  That might have turned this into a four star review.

Without the nostalgia factor, Chuck E Cheese becomes pretty average for an adult.  The kids loved it (hence the two extra stars), but I'd much rather go to Peter Piper Pizza.",2014-11-12 17:21:43,-0.40707806,-0.7813577,-0.045010395

There's a bar right by the elevator so you can grab a drink to take to your room after a long day on the show floor.

Just in location alone, at the end of a pier, in beautiful Santa Barbara, a small bar/shack restaurant, it is a fun and romantic set up.

The place is small and everyone is seated counter style along the kitchen and along the windows. There are some tables outside as well. You will get to know your neighbors, so get ready to be cozy. But I found this part of the charm and fun.

The seafood is fantastic. Fresh, simple and just a pleasure. I have been here twice, the first time we shared the 3 lb crab, shared the clam chowder and both had oyster shooters and an extra order of onion rings. The crab was fresh and that platter was worth it. The clam chowder had lots of chunks of clam and a good briny broth. The oyster shooters were delicious. The onion rings were more heavily battered than I liked, but still tasty.

The second time, we got ciopinno and clams strips. The cioppino was served in a large sour dough bowl brimming with a garlicky, spicy broth and chunks of scallops, shrimp, mussels and a side of crab. I LOVED IT. For winter time, this is the dish to get! We also got the clam strips and they were very well prepared. Not too heavily battered and the clams were tender.

My son ordered a double Chipotle Chili burger, onion rings and chocolate shake. He really enjoyed the burger (the bite I had was pretty good).

This place is located on a main road in a small strip mall.   

There is a main counter where you can order food and take it to go.  

We sat in the side room which had waiter service.  The waiter were really nice and helpful.

The kid had a chicken tender kids meal which was $5.  It came with two tenders and fries which was plenty for him for lunch.   

I had the Caprese chicken with a side bowl of tomato soup.  The Caprese had mozzerlla, tomoato, basil pesto on  grilled Italian bread.

Hubby had the Mushroom and feta with fries.  His sandwich had American provolone, muenster, feta, mushroom and argula.  

We each took a half a sandwich.   I wish I cut THOSE halfs in half. It was HUGE.  Three hours later we are still full.   The sandwiches were amazing.   The fries were tasty.

310,KJM7HUxmo0ADTlgZdDjj9g,injRjlVWnun5lgu_nQGDhA,rnaE88k8yV5pFAGJeiIK4Q,2.0,4,0,1,"So the sound quality here is odd.  We watched the same concert at two different locations, so it's easy to compare.

At this location, I couldn't understand what one of the acts was saying, seriously I understood none of the words.  I was wearing hearos Rock & Roll series earplugs, and chalked it up to those at the time as I've never used that type before.  At the other venue, I wore the same earplugs and understood the vast majority of the words he said.  So for the most part, it wasn't the earplugs (although side note, I highly recommend Hearos High Fidelity over any other type of earplug for concert going)

The show was sold out and the venue was much to tight for the amount of tickets they sold.  There would be no dancing, in fact, there would be no moving, every person that had to cross the crowd to get to the restroom was an ordeal for both that person and the crowd.  

The crowd was surprisingly rude in a variety of ways.  This is by no means my first such show, and I've been to the two co-headliners for this particular show combined, probably in the ballpark of 40x, so its not a ""oh gosh, occasionally folks push or mosh at a show""

Take note, the exact same 3 bands at another venue in San Francisco 2 days later yielded much more polite attendees, a much easier time moving through the crowd, less sticky, less aggressive, less so drunk you're worried they are going to puke on you, and less drinks tossed and splashing us by mistake.  At the SF show, maybe one person slightly annoyed me.  At the Reno show, there were plenty.

I get that some of these things are outside of the venues control, but many I believe are exacerbated by having folks so uncomfortable.  20 less tickets sold would have made all the difference in the world.  

If the person who threw the drink (at someone else, but nailing us as well) hadn't been stepped on and shoved so many times, would they have thrown the drink?  If there was slightly more space, would the dudebro have bothered to actually say to us ""I'm going to stand where you are standing now"" and literally force his way into where we had attempted to stand to stay out of the way of folks who wanted to get somewhere?  Would my toes have been stepped on so much?  Would people with long hair have been flpping their locks into your face?  Would I have had other folks sweat all over me?  Probably not.  They sold more tickets than they functionally have capacity for, if anyone was being honest about it.  

Their audio control guys have a little cage around their equipment, and the crowd was so large and so tightly packed, the barriers ended up getting moved back like 2 or 3 feet on the side that wasn't secured down.   This wasn't from anyone intentionally pushing it, it was from people pushing through the crowd, forcing people into it.  This is really oddly placed, in the middle of the venue.  Not middle back, middle MIDDLE, as in half the crowd is standing behind it and not because they don't want to be tightly packed, but because there is no other option.

There is no place to sit, unless you want to go up to the balcony and not see any of the show.  The balcony allows just a handful of people to go up and get a view pretty much the top of band member's heads.  And you know, that might have been better than the backs of strangers heads we got to see instead, while being sweated on, and being hit with drinks, and hit in the face with strangers hair.

As it stood, we watched very little of the actual show because we spent so much time doing problem avoidance.

All said and done, would I go here again?  Yes, IF there was no better venue option within 4 hours of me and this is a band I really wanted to see OR if I thought it wouldn't sell out yielding a bit more functional space.

I would not however, attend this venue for a band I consider a ""maybe"".",2015-02-25 01:01:53,-1.4584377,-0.90609163,0.08508382

This was my 5th visit and this time we brought our neighboring family, so we had a party of 10. But, only 5 adults and no bar drinks. Even then, it took 30 minutes -- literally -- for the guacamole to come out. When the dinner was finally served about another 20 minutes later, it came out in 3 sets, the last being 10 minutes behind the 2nd set. My sweet 11 year old daughter patiently waited and waited for her steak taquitos, which was the same thing 2 of my other kids ordered, save for different meat.

Additionally, all the children's orders came out like apps, completely missing the beans and rice. So those had to be rushed.

Was the food good? Yeah sure, but the service and the kitchen timing were both train wrecks. Consequently, there's no way I'm going there again with any more than 2 people.

The food was terrible;
  Godzilla Roll; fish was completely cooked/mush
  Tuna Sushi; They had to sear/cook the outside of the fish and it was covered in a lemon pepper spice?  I felt that they were covering up the fact that the fish wasn't fresh so I wouldn't even eat it.
  Pink Cadillac; Fried to death / hard to chew
  Vegetable Gyoza; edible

The Service;
  There was no designated server.  Random waiters approach your table until you are ready.  We received 1/2 of our order within in 10 minutes and then waited about an hour for the sushi.  In the hour we waited not one person approached our table to see how we were doing or to explain what was taking so long.  It was confusing seeing how other tables received their sushi orders that came in after us.

I had wanted to go to BST back in the day and never made it but it really hasn't been on my list for a while. When we got the invite I was glad to accept. Good friends,I assumed food decent at worst, so sounded like fun. 
The setting . Big warehouse style building between 2 somewheres. 4th floor overlooking quasi industrialish part of the river. The crowd. Well it is a bit older. Median age 60 or 60+. The restaurant. They take the space and try to make as many tables as possible by the window overlooking river. 
Ok let's get down to food. We were 4. Opposite husband ordered crab gallette. I'm not a big sharer with other couples. It did look good. Somewhere between a cake and a mousse. He finished it. The wife got the vegetarian app. Lots of good choices on the menu imo. I wouldn't order but whatever. I ordered the escargots with sauteed mushrooms and red burgundy sauce. Honestly if this dish were at Ela or Stateside they'd add a lil jazz and the hipsters would be going batshit crazy. This was a very good dish. Red burgundy sauce just matched with snails and mushrooms so well. It was a grab an extra roll to sop it up kind of sauce. And the snails were nice and tender. My wife got the cold local corn soup. Well executed but I'm just not a huge cold corn fan. Very summer sweet.
Mains. Opposing husband got the salmon. Looked ok. Seemed a bit better done than  I prefer but I struggle all the time with this. Sauce looked nice. I got a scallop dish with sauteed veggies, potatoes and a bouillabaise sauce. Very nice. Sauce excellent. Scallops cooked properly. Not a home run but good food. My wife got the home run. Hangar steak cooked medium rare sliced down and in a red burgundy sauce. Side of green lentils. Hangar was perfectly cooked and had that extra meaty flavor that a good hangar steak should have. Burgundy sauce they just do it right. Wonderful dish.
We didn't order desert.
Here's the deal. Apps were 10-12 bucks. My escargots were $10. That's crazy cheap. The entrees were $23ish. Good quality. $5 less than many places. Wine was all Moore Brothers stuff.. No trophy wines just wine meant to be good drinking wine with food. And reasonably priced
It's not on the hipster to do list right now. But the food is very good for the price and if you renamed this restaurant and reopened it in a different section of the city it might be packed.

It's not a genre I ever eat unless I'm forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby's cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.

Been here MANY times in the past and planning on going here many times in the future! The Waterwheel is truly an iconic place and a great ""go-to"" restaurant for all of your needs.

Whether you choose to dine upstairs or down, you will always be treated to consistently great food. From the more standards like ginger ale roasted half chicken to the delicious specials, you will always leave full and happy! One recommendation would be to TRY to leave room for dessert as there is always something delicious, as well as an amazing bread pudding!!

The salmon on the salad I ordered instead was delicious, but the portion was tiny.  Salad greens were fresh, but the dressing was uninspired and low on flavor.  Worse than all of this?

Wonderful little vegetarian place, even for us carnivorous.
No over reliance on soy here, no tofu to ""replace"" meat, none of that at Blue Sage. No, here the dishes and vegetarian because they where meant to be vegetarian in there inception. 

The Chef manages to blend Cuban, Indian, Middle Eastern (Iranian?) and Mediterranean cuisines into something wonderful all on its own.
His use of cheese amazed me when i tried the Adobo Goat Cheese Nachos, the monchego works SO well it makes you question your taste buds. I would highly recommend it, along side with the Sonoma Sampler w/ the goat cheese.

Be warned, reservations are a must at Blue Sage, seeing how it is tiny, and expect to wait 15 min for your order to come out of the kitchen when its crowded. (made from scratch though) This place is perfect for a romantic dinner but it is pricey and a bit noisy.

Cons: 

The industrial, blacked-out aesthetic of the rooms does little to recall the vibrant energy of New Orleans. The one note of color was a cabinet painted with a beach-scene, but even this was off to the side and out of plain sight for the most part. The event space downstairs does a nice job showcasing local acts and music, and one wishes the designers would have nodded more towards the city's history than the brand's in the rooms as well. Cork flooring also retains dirt and walking barefoot in the room is not recommended. One other big con: the valet here is $45 a night, whereas the average in the city is around $25-$30 a night in similar hotels.

I bought a slice of cake to go ($2.44 including tax), and WOW. The cake was a subtle sweet, light, and airy. Although covered in powdered sugar, the sugar was not overpowering at all and just right. The cake, true to its name, was a bit crunchy on the outside (but not so hard you'll break your teeth) and gooey in the middle. The crunchy topping was an added texture bonus. What an absolute delight!

The only thing that seemed to bring relief was deep tissue massage, and those results were temporary. After a particularly bad day, I called EFC in desperation for some healing.

Now, with two adjustments a week to get me back on track, I have never felt better and I'm finally free of pain!

The added bonus was a totally revitalized fitness routine. As an avid runner, I was certain that icing my knees after a long run was simply a fact of life.

Dr Caley's office is warm and inviting, and he gives every patient his sincere and undivided attention. Watching him with other patients while in the waiting area is so refreshing; it's evident he is passionate about not only his practice but also every person that walks through the door.

Being a transplant from Portland, I've wanted to check out the Ace Hotel in NO for a minute. Then I read about the rooftop pool access for locals and decided to try it out. I had read about the pool becoming over capacity, so I was a little nervous we'd be turned away. It had also just rained and the sky was still pretty gray, and I wasn't sure if the pool was even gonna be open. But lucky for us, the weather started to clear up just as we got up to the rooftop.

C and I ordered some food and drinks and got comfortable on the chaise lounges. C just had some beers and I tried cocktails. The first one I had had habanero in the list of ingredients but didn't have much of a kick in my opinion. I then tried the el camino real, which I liked much better. For food, we had the octopus and the shrimp. They were both good, but the shrimp was *really* good. The green sauce was everything.

The pool was nice. Nice, shallow social pool. I'm short, so I was still pretty submerged. It really is a perfect depth for me, as often I'm tiptoeing to keep my head above water in pools.

The food and drinks aren't cheap, but the added bonus of the pool is nice, and it's such a beautiful space. I'm a fan.",2016-07-17 04:06:47,-0.89028054,-0.24584427,-0.7297006

So maybe in this case, looks likes chicken, smells like chicken, tastes like chicken but ITS NOT!  Aww fake out.

I tasted the banana the most in the groothie which was filling in itself.

The place was small and jammed packed which was also another good sign.  There are about 4 spaces to sit inside and a small bench outside.

We lucked out on timing and got a chance to sit and eat.  Not sure if there is a park near by but worth getting for on the go.

We started with a light and flavorful burgundy.  All of us got the 3 courses for $34, a good deal since it is a bit pricey a la carte.  I started with the Trio de Provence, a tapenade, caviar, and montrachet cheese.  This was the only so-so course of the evening- good, but nothing stood out.  Next up was the beet salad, which was fantastic.  Beets are something I am just starting to get into having had canned and pickled beets as a kid that tasted, literally, like dirt.  I understand now that their earthy flavor is great when they are fresh and correctly prepared.  The salad also had capers, bacon, red onion, and goat cheese, all of which I love, and the combo is even better!  Can't really go wrong there, beets or no beets! My dad and BF ordered the caesar, which they both enjoyed.

For dinner, I had the salmon in mustard sauce, perfectly cooked and delicious with potato gratinee and sauteed veggies.  BF had the strip, which was wonderful, perfectly cooked and marbled with delicious bearnaise.  Irresistible pommes frites came with, so I helped myself to quite a few.  His three course selection included a dessert that I tried, a dark chocolate tart that was unbelievable.  So rich with a creme fraiche drizzle and fresh berries, we couldn't even finish it.  He had a perfectly prepared cup of french coffee to go with...mmmm mmmm!

I had a big to go box as their portions here are very large.  My dad mentioned that the difference between here and a restaurant in France is that the portions here are about triple the size.

Please allow me to hereby confirm the rumors: Village Whiskey does, in fact, have the best burger in Philadelphia. And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. 

As my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to ""make me something awesome with whiskey in it."" ""What kind of drink do you want?,"" he inquired. ""I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these."" (Perhaps my banter wasn't quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the ""The Commodore"" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.

When our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can't wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.

Warning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. 

All in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable. I would totally come back.

Still dreaming of that burger,

As a patient of Dr. Velez's since 2010, I have only ever had positive experiences at Sonrisa. Historically I have had some traumatic dental experiences, and finding a new dentist that is calm, skilled, and caring for patients had been quite the struggle. Since becoming a patient at Sonrisa, I actually look forward to my dental visits! The dental hygienist (Rebekah) is very skilled, and explains what she's doing as she is doing it. She also makes recommendations on flossing and toothbrushes if asked. Although I only come 2x/year, Dr. Velez always remembers small details about my life, which conveys that he is invested in his patients' care and well-being. Recently, I had to come to Sonrisa to get a cavity re-filled, and was having tremendous anxiety about the procedure. It was the calmest, least painful dental procedure I have ever had (and unfortunately I have had a lot to compare it to!) I no longer live in Philadelphia, but travel 3.5 hours and pay out-of-network fees just to stay with Sonrisa and Dr. Velez. I highly recommend this dental practice to anyone looking for a dentist in Philadelphia.

 A couple of added bonuses:
- The office is super nice with lots of light and high-tech computer screens at each chair
- Dr. Velez is bilingual in Spanish/English",2014-03-18 12:22:34,-1.5989633,0.1227997,0.9160141

The location is pretty easy to get to as long as it isn't rush hour, and they have plenty of parking in the parking lot for the strip mall of businesses that they are set up in. There is quite a bit of outdoor seating in a patio area in front of the business, and a lot more seating inside that is composed of some second-hand mismatched furniture (including a few couches). Ordering is done at their bar that has a large chalkboard behind it with the available beers on tap.
 
It's a fairly busy interior with lots of stuff hanging everywhere, including a significant amount of awards that they have won for their beers. There are also lots of branded items that you can buy. They have 6-packs of their canned beer already cold that you can purchase to-go, or you can make a build your own 6 pack. You can also fill growlers here. The beers from this brewery are always done exceptionally well for the style, but they also lack some of the more unique beers that a lot of other breweries like to make. They have 8 or 9 beers on tap at any time, and they usually cover a decent spectrum of beer styles. This is definitely a brewery that isn't going to put out anything that isn't done well.

They have quite a few unique events here that can be easily found on their website, including a night especially for dogs, live music, and even a euchre night. Wednesday is their pint night with the fantastic offering of $4 pints. There was a food truck here the last time I visited, but I think that is only a once a week occasion (but don't quote me on that). They did have a few snack items available if needed to buy something to tide you over while drinking. 

I don't make it here very often since it requires a drive to get here, but it is definitely a stop I would make if I was going to be in the area. If you like great beer in a relaxed atmosphere, this is definitely your place. Additionally, and this may be a little judgmental of me, but the crowd here seems to be a little more ""normal"" than some other breweries.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Unlike some of the new-age ice cream spots that have sprung up across the country (Salt & Straw http://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-and-straw-portland-2?osq=Salt+Straw and Smitten http://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-3 come to mind), Mike's is your traditional ice cream parlor right in line with some of the gems in New York and Chicago. The flavors are on the board, the cones lined up in their stands, and the servers fast and friendly. What more could you want? Star Granted. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

Very much unlike the new age spots, the prices at Mike's couldn't be more affordable, and my single scoop in a cone, which was sizable as you can see in the picture, was priced at only $3.50. That's value. Star Granted. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

Before going into my actual Caramel Cone selection, I'll point out that Mike's wins when it comes to flavor variety. Simply too often I've rolled into modern ice cream or gelato spots only to find that I either have basic chocolate and vanilla to choose from or some kale and blueberry goat cheese nonsense. Mike's leaves the gentrification at the door, offering up a huge selection of classics, contemporary flavors, and combinations of the two that are sure to satisfy anyone. 

My caramel cone in particular was very, very good, with the right ratio of caramel to cone and ice cream. Single Star Granted. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

As far as I'm concerned, Mike's is the best ice cream in Nashville, and a classic like this would easily secure my patronage daily. Star Granted.",2015-10-18 20:04:07,-0.13368697,-0.067867905,0.120014384

First off, we were greeted by an unenthusiastic waitress who was very cold and short with all of us. We started off by ordering 3 apps: the pierogies, crispy duck salad and cheese board. All of these items were delicious, however the portions of the cheese were completely underwhelming. Four people were suppose to share the cheese board. While the presentation was cute with the mouse shaped goat cheese, the portions of the individual cheeses seemed as if they were fit for a mouse! Each person basically got a crumb of cheese to taste. Moving on to the entrees, two of us ordered the scallops, one person ordered the lamb and another ordered the beef stroganoff. The scallops were good, but the best dish was the beef. We have dined all over the city and the country. The aspect about The Love that left us with the poorest taste in our mouth was the fact that this place charges $1 per person for water (still or sparkling). Mind you, it's not bottled still or sparkling, it's super filtered Philadelphia water. To top it off, there is no complimentary bread or rolls served. You must pay $5 for the Parker house rolls with chive butter, which, in my opinion, were not worthy of the price tag. Overall, the food was good, not great and we do not plan to recommend or return.

Went right before the lunch rush on a Thursday.  Line was pretty short, and moved along pretty fast with plenty of open tables.   

They have an abundance of meats and sides and I ordered the brisket with an add-on of sausage and for sides collards, smoked jalapenos and fried pickles and it came with a biscuit.  All of it looked good but in the end it was meh since my entire entree was basically luke warm almost cold, which was surprising since I watched them take out a fresh brisket and I got the first slices but surprisingly it was not hot (not even warm).  The brisket, albeit room temp, was good.  The sausage wasn't anything special, but still good.  As for the sides: collards, good but nothing to get excited over.  They do use ham hock but it's missing some more salt and some of the vinegar tang to it.  The smoked jalapenos are stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon, which sounds amazing, but this is the type of side that needs to be fresh.  It def had a great taste and probably would be amazing if it had just come out of the oven.  The fried pickles had the potential to be amazing, they use thick cut round garlic pickles (my fav) but then they just put way too much breading on them that if you ate them with the breading you lost the taste of the pickle.  Finally, the biscuit.  It look good, it's a heavy dense kind (not light and flaky at all) and I commented on if it was hot that butter and honey would be amazing on it (but alas it was not hot and there was no butter to be found, though didn't see honey).  

So all in all, it was just okay.  It has the potential to be great, but with everything being luke warm and mostly bland it just turned me off.  There are other BBQ places around that are just as good so I'm not sure I'll be back.",2016-01-07 18:22:07,0.40710095,-0.6584032,-0.33224335

Because I had placed my initials in the oil filter and wrote in the tires the initials FL (front left) FR and so on.   But wait there is more.
About one year later I go back for the 20000 free oil change.  But soon after my undercarriage fell off.  They forgot or broke the harness after opening the oil release bolt.

1. Cassidy is incredibly organized, patient, and professional.  She provided us detailed timelines and schedules that alleviated loads of stress from the pre-wedding and day-of planning.  Throughout the planning process she responded quickly to ideas or concerns, and was an extremely reliable guide.  Her attention to detail and knowledge of the industry helped us make the best decisions possible to have both the wedding we wanted and one that we could afford.  

2. Cassidy coordinated an amazing team of vendors who worked together seamlessly to create a perfect wedding day.  Every vendor Cassidy suggested was professional, within our budget and a delight to work with.  Both Cassidy and our photographer came to the wedding rehearsal to get acquainted with our family, and to discuss the set-up with the venue staff.  On the day-of she coordinated the set-up with all the vendors and put the finishing touches on our décor.  She was so dependable and did such a great job communicating with our vendors that it really allowed us to enjoy precious time with our friends and family before the wedding. 

3.  Cassidy's dependability and attentiveness are unmatched.  Every time I started to worry over something it turned out that she had already thought of it and had taken steps to either avoid or remedy it.  She even had an emergency cosmetics bag ready for me on the wedding day!  I really can't express how essential she was in helping us have a stress free wedding.                 

After working with Cassidy it is clear that she has an inherent passion for this industry and for making her clients happy.  She went well above and beyond to help us achieve our perfect wedding, and was truly excited to be a part of it.  It was SUCH a pleasure to work with her!  We got so many compliments on our wedding, and are beyond thankful to have been able to enjoy our special day thanks to the superb work of Cassidy Rae Events!",2013-06-26 17:52:46,-1.1424913,-0.12983154,0.6191832

The restaurant seemed nice and cozy - it was almost a perfect place to enjoy a meal with the family after a ""hard"" day under the sun at the beach. We orderred some apetizer and entrée as soon as we got seated. The apetizer came out rather quickly, and they were excellent! Especially the white wine clams. The buffalo wings and calamari were good too. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. The entrées took almost 2 HOURS to be served. Granted, there were 7 people in our party, and the kitchen might have had to wait a little for all of the dishes to be ready for serving all at once, which I could understand  and appreciate. But I didn't  think it was the case because the 6-person party next to us and couple of smaller parties around us got their food way before us even though  they placed their orders after us. We queried the nice waitress multiple  times as we started to lose our patience, and she had no clue as to why it took so long. Finally, the food came out, only after we had lost our cool and had to express some discontent to the waitress. Well, besides the ungodly long wait, the entrées were not too far from a total disappointment! The pizza was of Pizza Hut quality, and the crust was noticeably stale as if it was pulled out of the oven centuries ago. The meatball spaghetti was a dish of disaster mainly because of the mediocre marinara sauce on top of a clump of inadequately cooked noodles. Other dishes were aceptable but barely noteworthy.

I've been here several times and I've always had such a great experience. Let me say if you want to try it, call ahead and get a reservation. They don't require one, but you may not get to eat when you want. I've always been lucky, but I get there at open or near closing time, I never seem to want to eat at the appropriate times, but that's a win for me, usually.

My recent visit was with the wife. She and I went on Sunday morning prior to church. I got the biscuits and gravy and she got the frittata. Let me first start with the B&G, as I seem to think I'm quite the expert. Fantastic! The biscuits, light, fluffy, moist but somehow hearty and really holds up to the gravy; it was amazing. The gravy, not too thick, not too runny and had local sausage (found in Southhampton or Lindenwood Park area. I forgot the shops name, sorry). It has a really nice spice to it, so it stays with you, but only for a minute. The serving was two biscuits on a huge plate with tons of gravy. I wasn't left wishing I had more gravy, but I was left with about 1/2 biscuit because I just couldn't eat it all. It came with a side of bacon and oh man was that delicious, too. 
The wife had the frittata. If you don't know, it's similar to quiche, in my opinion. This was amazing. Made with egg, onion, mushroom and maybe spinach, I can't recall and served with a side of mini-arugula salad and black walnuts, lightly dressed with a balsamic dressing of sorts. The frittata was cooked in a small, cast iron dish, which is just really cool and the eggs were fluffy and moist, but they were runny at all. It was perfectly cooked!

Now the coffee. I drink coffee and I always drink it decaf, so I'm looking for a super dark, super tasty cup and here is where you get it. My wife drinks coffee way more than I do and I didn't initially get coffee, but she did. Of course she likes the caffeine. After her's arrived I wanted to try it prior to her ""dressing it up"". I was amazed at how delicious it was. It was Dominican Republic good. (that's my measure). I immediately ordered a decaf version. I was skeptical because it's hard to get good decaf in a restaurant. People assume because you don't drink caffeine that you like your stuff weak and without taste. Not the case here. It was dark, silky, bold and simply fantastic. 

Oh, the monkey bread; I forgot to mention the monkey bread. I can't believe it. This stuff was so good and went perfect with our coffee while we waited for our main courses. Quite honestly, we could have just had that and been satisfied for a couple of hours. This delicious concoction of cinnamon bread pieces baked together with pecans and topped with house-made caramel icing is such a treat. It's plenty big enough for two people to share. As you break off a piece you expose the next delicious piece and as you get to the middle you find a treasure of pecans and cinnamon. I don't even like pecans (lived on a pecan grove in MS as a child and got my fill of them with over one-hundred trees just outside the house). Warm, moist, delicious. Perfect

 This place has great ambiance and the service is fantastic. Their menu changes regularly (a sign of a true restaurateur). It's how you do it at home, right? You use whatever fresh ingredients you have, why wouldn't you expect the same at a restaurant? It's what's wrong with this country...everything is too familiar. Nothing stands out on it's own and I'm glad to see that food is trying to get America back to being ""regional"". I, unlike many, don't like that I can go to Seattle and get the same stuff I can get in Denver, St. Louis or Baltimore. I like that certain regions of the country and even world have their own distinct tastes. Ok, I've gone off on a tangent. Not the point of this review.

Go here, try it, love it, tell your friends, write about it and repeat. Oh, the prices are very reasonable for a place with this quality. You're not going to get a $5 breakfast, but you will get your money's worth.",2013-05-31 13:40:58,-0.3561981,0.40938568,-0.3849331

Marathon is a local favorite with a few locations around Philadelphia, with good food, a nice amour of space and decent prices--it often reminds me of a modern, upscale diner. In fact, Marathon is often a brunch spot for me since their brunch quesadilla with chorizo is big and delicious!

For dinner, I opted for the Marathon Burger ($11.50). They also have the option of customizing your burger, but I went with the pre-customized menu version. The temperature of the burger was good, just a hair over medium rare, and it was amazingly juicy, greasy and messy in the best way possible--all burgers should be a little messy! For their beef, Marathon uses a blend of short rib, sirloin and chuck. The party tasted very gourmet, and because there was a blend of cuts, it had a nice amount of fat that kept the burger incredibly moist.

The tomato wasn't sliced too thick, and the lettuce was easy to take off as I don't usually like lettuce on my burgers. The applewood smoked bacon was cooked through, but still a kept some chewiness, which I love. I hate when bacon is super crisp and it's lost all of its porkiness and meatiness. On the other hand, the bacon wasn't flabby, and had a subtle smoky taste.

The BBQ sauce was slathered on the bottom half of the bread and also helped keep the sandwich moist--and wet. The sauce itself was spicy and had a nice bite to it--interesting, but in a good way. The cheese didn't have a very bold flavor, but helped the sandwich keep a creamy consistency. The sweet, caramelized onions were on point and played well with the spicy BBQ sauce, especially since there was a generous portion of them on the burger. The burger was served on a country, brioche bun that was strong enough to stand up to the heavy burger. It had a slight, pleasant sweetness to it.

I wasn't in the mood for fries, or for the other side choice of Caesar salad on the menu, so I substituted some spinach for the fries. The spinach was served in a small bowl on the burger plate and was cooked with a nice amount of garlic, though perked up a lot with some salt.

My friend ordered the Grilled Salmon ($15.50), which was glazed with a whole grain honey mustard sauce. The fish was cooked well, and stayed moist. The mustard wasn't too strong as to overpower the salmon. The mashed potatoes were super creamy and absorbed some of the juice and sauce from the salmon. The accompanying asparagus was a smaller portion, but tasted delicious. The stalks weren't mushy, and still had great texture. 

The restaurant staff was very friendly, and the servers were enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu. Marathon Grill was a solid weekday dinner option with a tasty, comforting old school burger.",2015-05-13 22:56:40,0.76114213,0.44053784,-0.21883294

She was very thorough in explaining to me exactly how sugaring worked (apparently it is less painful than waxing because it doesn't take off any skin cells), what she would be doing (also asking me exactly how much hair removal I wanted), what I needed to do to prepare myself, and also how everything is sterilized and kept clean from one client to the next.

I felt very at ease during my treatment and the pain was totally manageable (to be fair, I do have a high tolerance for pain). The esthetician did a great job and I was nice and smooth for a week before regrowth started coming in. I wish I'd heard about this technique earlier as it would have been nice to do before a beach vacation!

They also have a loyalty card where you get a stamp for every $35 you spend on sugaring. Your 5th stamp gets you 10% off, and 10 stamps get you a free sugaring session. The only thing I didn't love was that the room I was in was right next to the front desk, so I suspect that if you are screaming in pain, people would probably hear you. No biggie for me though. I don't know how popular sugaring is but I would definitely recommend coming here to do it!",2017-10-04 20:19:37,-1.225771,-0.8714955,0.84969074

...wait...no that I think about it, that's pretty pricey for pup. I can get a manicure and a pedicure for $35 and get pampered for an hour and a half to two hours. She get pampered for 10 minutes and it costs me $20?!

It's okay, it's okay. The prices here are more reasonable than what I've seen another pet shops. Plus, I tried to do it myself and my pup and I almost had it out! Best leave it up to a professional.

They offer chalking, stenciling and feathering for pets. Perfect for Halloween. 

You will always find sales going.

They offer obedience classes here.

Oh, and I'm on a wheat-free diet. What to do? Solution: online ordering from Domino's! 

Wrong. 100% wrong.

I sit here having consumed a gluten-free* pizza that was both burned and cold, delivered to my home half an hour after the delivery time that was promised both by the website and the gentleman who called to confirm my order. Not long before it arrived, I called the store back to see if they knew where my pizza might be; the person who answered either couldn't find my order or simply assumed a lack of intelligence on my part. (""You ordered online? Are you sure it was from here?"" No, I just picked a random Domino's to call.) I get it, it's Saturday night, but two people told me it was going to get here 30 minutes before it did. And then it was burnt. And cold. And I was super-hungry so I ate it anyway. The only positive was that I paid less for it than I would have otherwise because there was an online coupon, but it's not enough to make me bump up a star.

*Gluten-free, in that the crust is not made with gluten-containing ingredients.

She took over a week to call me back, and in order to even get in touch with her, I had to call the salon more than a couple of times to remind her that I wanted a refund.  When she got me on the phone, she said that she couldn't offer me a refund because I refused to let anybody else in the salon ""fix"" my hair.  HELLO?!... After suffering quite a hackjob of a haircut like I experienced, who would want ANYBODY to cut MORE of their hair off, let alone from the SAME SALON!?... No.  I said that the only solution was to let it grow out.  And she lied and said Bridget had offered me a refund the day I went in to complain, which was not true.  What she said was that in two weeks, if I still didn't like my ""haircut"", that the owner could give me a refund.  So thankfully I did end up getting a refund.  And I better have, because there is no way anybody should have to pay $40 for Bridget to destroy their hair.  But it's a shame, because I'm sure Gina is a good hairstylist.  And that was the person my friend recommended to me.  But because she ""doesn't take any more clients"", I was stuck with Bridget.  So if you go here to get your hair cut, you are getting a young hairstylist fresh out of school who has no real idea what they are doing.
So, it's been about a month since my experience here, and it's finally growing out a bit.  I did just take a trip back home to see my normal hairstylist so that she could fix what Bridget did, and she gasped when she saw it.  I was like, ""Don't be mad at me, I didn't touch it.  It was the last person who cut my hair right after the new year!""  She was like ""I see that, where did all your hair go?!""  
She is an extremely talented hairstylist (hair genius) with decades of experience and her own salon, and the ways she described Bridget's cut are as follows:
""A sophomore haircut.""
""Yeah, she just worked way too fast, SHAVING your hair down the strand.""  
""She gave you a mullet.""
Even the other hairstylist in the shop was like, ""Wow, where did you go to get that piece of work?!""
It's been confirmed.

I think we had the same wait person twice. We had different people for drink orders, appetizers, dinner, dessert and food delivery.   It made it difficult to flag down the right person for another drink or fork or whatever we needed. Some of them seemed just as lost as us. 

The food was amazing and some of it was almost inedible. For appetizers, the duck spring rolls were my favorite and the pork belly was really good too. I was not a fan of their gumbo but my mom enjoyed the gumbo ya-ya. I did like their soup of the day which was sweet potato and chorizo.  For entree's we got the shrimp and grits, truffle butter filet, crab ravioli and pork chops. By far the pork chops were the best. Best pork chops I've ever had. The shrimp and grits were good. The crab ravioli was undercooked and just ok. The horrible thing of the evening was the filet. It was a beautiful cut and cooked perfectly.

Just kidding but no really they do have cats, do you need to know anything else? They seem to be running a sort of halfway house for kitties and they take donations. I don't know what this has to do with canoeing but who cares! They're doing a good thing. Anyway we decided to avoid the weekend crowds and go on a Wednesday. When we called them up on Tuesday night to reserve a canoe they said that we were the only people at that point to even make a reservation. We got there early to try to get out on the river before the heat of the day and I'm sure glad we did. Good lord we couldn't have picked a better day! Not too hot, lots of breeze and passing clouds. Although I did burn the tops of my knees, we didn't roast out there. 

They have different trip options with varying lengths at affordable prices and the nice thing is they have an army of 'dudes' to haul the canoe in and out of the river for you. They provide life jackets but no instruction on how to canoe, although we didn't ask. Honestly though, it is self explanatory and really you don't learn how to do it until you are actually in the boat experimenting anyway. I highly recommend bringing lunch, hat and water. I don't recommend swimming because the Harpeth runs up against lots of farm land, which means lots of run off, which means lots of pollution. It's very very pretty, if not a little trashed - we saw a bunch of tires and bud light beer cans. It's mostly quiet and in some places all you can hear is the breeze and water.

For myself, I ordered the ""Lunchbox,"" which is a revolving lunch special that, for $14, includes a beverage, lunch special of the day, and dessert. Not too shabby. The lunch special the day we were there was a tuna nicoise salad, and it was also excellent. The dessert was a chocolate cake with fresh berries that definitely did not disappoint. 

Since our visit took place during lunch on a Saturday, we ordered a couple of adult beverages with our meal. I had a fantastic cider, and he tried a beer called White Rascal that I called ""the best Belgian white beer I have ever had."" So yum. 

Service was attentive, and the decor was much more robust than when a restaurant called Nosh last occupied the space. However, the main dining area isn't very large (maybe 8-10 tables).

We didn't go up there, but this place seems like it would be perfect for a birthday party, shower, or other special event. Also, the location can't be beat, and with some recent closures, I'm glad to see a new restaurant in Maplewood. I just hope it's able to stick around longer than some of the other restaurants in the area did, so I can come back again and again.",2012-03-05 22:38:09,0.2837094,-1.0527297,0.21557024

Sure El Rey is delicious, but their prices are pretty high unless you go to their happy hour which is usually so packed you can barely get an order in. I've gone to this place twice after church, and have enjoyed it both times. I think I might have found a new Sunday tradition.

Ambiance: A pretty small joint with bright colors that really liven up the room. While the restaurant can only sit about ~20 people, the lively colors and open garage door window really opens up the place. 

Food: $9 for three tacos and a side of chips might seem expensive, but they are loaded up with the protein of your choosing. You can choose your topping too, but don't go overboard aka keep it simple, stupid. These tacos only need a few things: a bit of salsa, pickled onions, and maybe some lettuce if you are into that. Sure you can pile on cheese, guac, and sour cream but you will lose the flavor of the meats.

Speaking of which, the al pastor is by far the best option. They have it on a spit and slice it off fresh and sear it each time you order. You get just the right amount of citrus in each bite. The carnitas are good, but if you want to go with pork, stick with the al pastor. The short rib barbocoa is super juicy and savory, but can be too heavily salted for some people.

Service: Since this is a fast-casual restaurant, service is pretty much limited to that behind the counter. All the employees I've interacted with have been considerate and kind, especially when I ask for more toppings.

Drinks: Selection of American and Mexican coke/soda products, so no complaints here. If you need water, you can ask and the employees can bring you a glass for free.",2018-05-30 19:21:53,0.49938452,0.71554065,-0.3764467

We were coming down from NYC and initially were going to go somewhere else.  Well the rental car fell through and we lucked out with finding this place.  From the train station it was maybe a 10 minute walk. to the location.  Clean and VERY professional but welcoming us as newcomers and first time shooters.  We took the class and what impressed me what that another guy was sitting in the class and they asked him if he had been drinking and he said no, he was just tired from his trip.  Nope sorry guy...they asked him to come back tomorrow in the nicest way and told him that they can't even offer him the class if he wasn't alert or feeling well.  I was astounded and relieved that they choose safety of not just the guy but of us as well rather than just make a sale on a lesson or range time.

I learned how to hold a gun and while I was nervous, our trainer Mike was awesome!  He took time explaining safety and how to shoot to me over and over again.  When I finally hit the range and by the time my second shot went off I was completely confident and moved from a 9mm to an AK-47!  Now the bigger the gun the bigger the kick back and it is really hard to hit your target especially if you are new to shooting but I got 2 bulls eye and I was happy.  They showed us guns and explained them all and since we took 2 lessons and brought extra ammo the owner was nice enough to throw in the rental of the AK-47 in free.

The only negative thing I can say about them was they recommended Pat's or Gino's for Philly cheese steaks and they both sucked!

I will recommend on a separate note to bring a change of clothes and wet wipes which we did.  It was super hot that day and after sweating and all that gun powder on us we hit the bathroom and cleaned up.  Made a huge difference.",2012-10-13 22:45:54,-1.2756686,-0.19734824,-0.8608693

Those places are crap. 

I'm a lover of the south side pizza joints. Nick & Vito's and Roseangela's are the two best pizza places in Chicago, period. If I go dish Due's and Gino's are preferred. 

I digress, 312 Pizza is definitely a super noisy place and they really need to focus on the wait staff. Other folks have commented that they sat with empty beer/wine glasses for several minutes or so. This is a big no-no in the restaurant business. Hopefully they work out these kinks in the coming months.  The pours on Vino were also pretty weak. Look, I know you have ""measured"" amount that you've instructed your bartenders to abide by but c'mon, get a little bit  more generous on the pour. 

Otherwise, the food is good. I haven't ordered a dish pizza yet but the thin cracker crust reminds me of home. Good flavor with the sauce and the sausage crumble was italian chicago authentic. Bravo. 

I'm really hoping 312 can overcome some of these underlining issues as we need it to survive. I've only been down here for a few years and I'm already bored of the neapolitan places that are saturating this market (Desano's, Five points, etc).

Make sure to try a Mule, which is your choice of vodka, whiskey, or rum (I think) mixed with ginger beer, served in an almost too cold to touch pewter mug. Go for Mule Mondays and get them half priced!

They replaced my brakes, trans fluid, oil change and timing belts and took a look at the three or for other things I'd asked them to do, realized it the car really didn't need it done and didn't charge me a dime for the stuff that wasn't replaced even though they took the time to look into it.

I had been missing that option for a while, as I'm very used to getting pizza by the slices back home, since I can't eat a whole pizza on my own, and I'm usually running off to do something.  Although it can be a wait sometimes, when you are ordering a whole pie, the pizza here is one of my favorites in the city.  It's also nice that I have a place to go for a super late night eat.

But aside from the pizza, since there are many reviews on the pizza.  I want to focus on the other dishes that are available now.  From thursday to sunday, New York Pizza offers an alternative menu for lunch and dinner.  The alternative menu features traditional Italian entrees (e.g., parmesan, marsala, pepperonata, piccante) your option of chicken or veal that comes with a salad, fresh made al dente pasta, and 2 slices of garlic and italian herb bread. The portion is large, usually 3 pounded pieces of chicken/veal, and you can easily share the dish with another person.  I highly recommend the parmesan and the marsala dishes, however, I did not like the piccante (capers are not really my thing), and I have yet to try the pepperonata.

I cannot neglect some of the appetizers, you can order an AWESOME French onion soup, and yummy eggplant parmesan.

I would like to say that I often think of the French onion soup at New York Pizza now, and it is the biggest draw for me to go there between thursday and sunday.  The onions, you can tell, have been slow cooked on a low heat and caramelized to perfection, and the broth (vegetable) is so flavorful.  The bread is tender in the savoury tasting broth, and there is a generous, but perfect amount of melted cheese on top.  When I was eating it, I was just having fun scooping up the soup, bread, onions, and twirling the hot melted cheese around my spoon.  Writing this is making me want to go get some right now.

The breading on the eggplant parmesan and the entree parmesan are the same, and I definitely love it.  Usually, I don't eat eggplant, but in this form, it was very good.  It was fresh, the breading was fresh and crisp, again with a mix of italian herbs, and it was not overly greasy, like you would find in other places.

What is this that I've also heard recently and got to try?  The chef added chicken fingers for children that also comes with a salad, the breading is the same that is used for the parmesan, and let me say, it was fresh and delicious.  You could switch out some slices of chicken fingers for mozzarella sticks, whatever your kids, or maybe yourself would like.

I think I'll hit up New York Pizza again some time this weekend. Whether for pizza or pasta, it's all good.",2013-05-30 21:11:18,0.08566548,0.20176329,-0.00306467

I booked with this venue in the beginning of my engagement after meeting with Pat. He spent the entire meeting discussing all the lovely renovations that would be done prior to our wedding taking place.  Pat said that the renovations would be done over the summer (well before my wedding would take place in June the following year).  A few months later (after little communication from my initial meeting with Pat) we had our food tasting.  The food tasting was an absolute disaster. From the food being disgusting and bland and tasting like high school cafeteria food, to receiving a $60 check afterwards because our mothers came.  We were completely livid.  But the icing on the cake was the zero renovations that still hadn't been done, months after we paid the deposit. The very next day I left Pat a voicemail and sent him an email.  I'm a paralegal, so I'm extremely thorough and attentive to detail.  I emailed Pat all of my correspondences with Melissa showing that she never stated that I couldn't bring our 2 freaking parents and asked for the full refund.  I also mentioned the renovations that he promised that clearly weren't ever done.  Pat became a completely different person.  He said the food tasting was only for the bride and groom.  I explained that it was never stated in any paperwork that it was complimentary for just the two of us.  Our mothers paid for the wedding, and I don't eat meat so I would like more than one person's review of this food.  I also asked how can you charge for additional food, when you still presented us with one plate for everyone to share.  He said it's their policy and no refund would be issued.  Then I asked about the renovations and why the venue looked exactly the same.  First, he acted as if he never made any promises about renovations, then after I kept asking several questions, he back tracked and said that it's hard to get the licenses for renovations in the county.  So basically, no renovations would be done prior to my wedding.  At this point I was absolutely livid.  First if you are going to nickel and dime me now for freaking $60 then this is going to be a long process.  Second, I would have never ever booked with that venue based on how it looked.  Everything in the ballroom looked outdated, the carpet was dingy and old, and the venue as a whole looked old, and I literally had stopped looking at venues based off the lies Pat had told us. So, I told Pat that I was unhappy and would rather book somewhere else and that I wanted my deposit back.  Initially, he said no.  Then when I threatened legal action, he gave us our deposit back immediately.
THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS DONT BOOK WITH PAXON HOLLOW. From Pat being a con artist, to Melissa they are just horrible and honestly seem as if they don't fully comprehend customer service.  Two weeks after firing Paxon Hollow, I booked with Regal Ballroom and we just got married on June 10th.  They were literally the polar opposite of Paxon Hollow. Netty, and Chris were so amazing and attentive. The food at the food tasting was amazing, we were allowed to bring our moms, the entire venue was brand new and by the wedding day they had even made some tweaks to the bridal suite, we were able to keep the same date as before, had a million times better customer service, and paid a lot less then Paxon Hollow.  

P.S. See Dan's May 2017 review on wedding wire where he also outlines the poor customer service, the horrible food, and the ""renovations"" that Pat is promising to everyone",2017-06-20 15:30:43,-0.7876305,-0.5487153,-0.60353976

I used to travel quite frequently  and was a diamond member for a long time.  I no longer travel therefore I don't maintain a ""high status"" with hhonors any longer.   I have always been loyal to the Hilton brands and have always loved ed Embassy Suites specifically.
Unfortunately,  this particular visit  didn't even come remotely close to what I have come to expect from this hotel brand.  I booked a room 3 weeks in advance and got to the lobby at about 4:30Pm on 3/12.  This adventure started as we arrived in the lobby to stand in line behind about 10 other folks and 1 gentleman trying to check people in while a young lady (supervisor or manager) was dealing with an obviously upset customer.
once I got to the counter, the gentleman asked my name and obviously could not find my reservation and asked for my confirmation number.  I provided it and he magically found.  But the room is not ready.  He asked for my phone number so he could when it was ready.  We had a room under a different name which was also not ready and did the same thing.  At about 6PM, my companion stated he didn't have a good feeling so we called the hotel.  The gentleman we spoke with had no idea what we were talking about but took our number again.  
Shortly there after we headed back towards the hotel and my friend received a text stating his roo  was ready.  we got back and there was still a line of about 15 people so we decided to have a drink.  We finished our drinks and went up to the side counter and watched an irritated traveler state his case as the desk clerk simply looked at him.  Now came our turn.  
We got up to the desk clerk and gave him my name and was told my room was not ready.  I asked why not as it was now after 7PM.  He simply stated that all the rooms had not been cleaned.  I then stated this was unacceptable and asked when it would be ready.  He simply said he didn't know and there was nothing ready now.  Clearly, these guy wasn't going out of his way to try anything.  I asked for a Supervisor and a young lady came out and magically got me a room.  She did offer a voucher for the restaurant which was nice of her but this should've never happened.
while we used our voucher, we found out that this was pretty typically of the check-in process and the employee we spoke to had only seen the owner 1 time in 4 years and the only Manager on staff that night was the Food and beverage Manager.  As it appeared the hotel was booked to capacity and we're clearly having check-in issues for 2 days in and row (ands we were told), or even would think management might want to be more involved.
the icing on the cake came when I got my bill the next day and saw I was charged an additional $24 for valet parking that was not optional.
My advice is to look at some other options in the downtown Tampa area as there are good choices there.  this is not one of them.",2016-03-17 14:53:35,-1.7526721,-0.31118956,-0.69100136

This stems from my past career needs, and my reluctance to shop for myself. I could usually find what I was looking for in apparel and even housewares. Most of the time enjoying good prices and or coupon savings.

I think the issue with this store is its location in what may be the saddest mall in the area. On this visit to VTC I estimated about 4 more closed businesses than just a month or so ago. I would guess at the occupancy being 33%, and that is probably being generous. The store seems understaffed, and somewhat under stocked. My better half felt there were bargains to be had in women's, I can't deny or confirm. 

When the time came to checkout we did have to wait longer than normal, so long that we decided to try and find another open register. There were several clearance sections throughout the store, if you have time and like a bargain they might be worth a look. Maybe if this mall revives, this Macy's will step up their game. I'd probably visit a different location if I was shopping for myself.",2016-03-07 23:41:55,-1.6976998,0.31219697,0.33573037

My wife and I have been coming to Yats in Broad Ripple for at least four years now, so I like to think that maybe I got the knowledge to give it a fair and honest review.  I've recently taken my son there, along with my daughter, my daughter in law, friends, etc. I like sharing good food places with friends, and the more people I bring in, the more I like it.
I'll bring up the ""Cons"" first before I get into the ""Pros"".
1: The Broad Ripple establishment: Parking can sometimes be a chore on that busy street. This is not Yats fault, and there is really nothing they can do about it, when you have Jazz Kitchen, Fresh Market, Sams Gyros, (expanded into the old Army surplus store), all on the same block. You just find a place and park. Be ready to walk a block or two. And WATCH while crossing that intersection.
2:  The Place itself can get VERY crowded. If I have ONE main issue with the place, it's not the food, or the staff, but the customers. Some of them seem not to understand (or they simply don't care), that the seating is limited, (the place is small), and thus they like to just ""hang out"" at the tables for a while after they eat, while other people are standing around looking for a place to sit. I've actually had to ask people if they would be so kind as to let other folks have their table since they could carry their conversations on outside.  Too many youthful hipsters with their egos....
3: I would say the biggest ""Con"" in the food is sometimes the run out. There's been times I've been craving the chili cheese etouffe and come in only to have them say ""Sorry we ran out 10 minutes ago""...

And now the ""Pros""....
1: Food:  The chili cheese etouffe and the mang choux chicken are my favorites.  There's been times that I have gone back and ordered seconds. Not because the portions are so small, but simply because it was so good. My son says that the Peanut Butter Pie is probably the best pie he has ever tasted.
2: Service: The service is excellent with a good staff.  Joe is an amazing man and very wonderful and friendly.
3: Atmosphere: A nice funky mix of New Orleans-esque kitsch and Broad Ripple weirdness seem to mesh quite well together. I've wanted the picture of the red cat for years. Sigh....
4: A nice and varied collection of peppers, salts, and spices for your food. 
5: Speaking of the food once again. The food has enough spice for those of us with ""Anglo"" tastes, and there is enough variation of spices to allow people to push it up to ""nuclear"" in hotness.  

Overall, this has become one of my most favorite places to eat. We did try the old Mass. Ave, location twice and while the food was good, the staffs attitude was a bit of a letdown. They are moving to a new location so hopefully there, they will do better things.
If I was to recommend this I would say ""Yes!""....

I called in a to-go order for one item and was told it would be 20 minutes. It took me 22 minutes to get there and I was asked to wait, which I did, thinking I would wait only while they finished packaging my food. A full 10 minutes after I got there, my food came out. What I was told would be 20 minutes turned into 32 minutes. I ordered Vegetable Biriyani (special instruction to make it spicy). I got what I ordered and enjoyed the meal. They were not busy. In fact, there were only two other customers there at the time. 

Two days later, I called from my home and placed another order. I ordered the exact sme thing and was again told it would be 20 minutes. Knowing I had to wait last time, I planned on it taking 30 minutes and left my home accordingly. Bad traffic enroute caused me to arrive at the resuaurant (hole-in-the-wall, dive, dump) 40 minutes after I placed my order. I was told to have a seat and they'd get my food. I asked why it wasn't ready yet as it had been double the time they said and was told it was on the way. 

Realising quickly that it wasn't, I inquired again and was told the same thing, but I can go ahead and pay. I did not. I asked why 25 minutes after I was told my order would be ready, it wasn't ready yet. The answer I was given was that It's coming and thet I can go ahead and pay for it. I did not. I told them this is not an example of good customer service and I would expect my food within 2 minutes or I would leave. During these two minutes, I was told three more times that I should pay for my order, to which I made it clear that I would not until I was satisfied my order was delivered before my deadline. 

My food came out of the kitchen at the deadline and I was asked again to pay for it. Before doing so, I wanted to inspect the food. Upon loking in the container, I noticed it looked different then it did two days prior. My first thought was that it was not prepared spicy, as I had ordered. I asked if it was spicy. They said it was not spicy, but regular...and proceeded to tell me my total once again. I told them this is not what I ordered and that I would not pay for it or anything else here again. They said they'd take it back and fix it. Too late. By now they had taken almost 50 minutes to make something they originally told me would take 20 minutes. 

At this point, another person there came out and said they had accidentlly given my order to someone else. Ok, if this had happened, they had plenty of time to make another order for me. But we know this did not happen and they were just plain lying to me. 

I left without paying. Shame, as the food I got two days before was actually good. It would not have as bad if they had any customer service skills. Not once did anyone apologise for the delay or problem. Not once did anyone offer me a glass (or bottle) of water, or any other beverage. The only things they would say to me were that the food was coming and that I could pay.

However, today when we tried to place our order (like we usually do once every week or two) we were informed that we were ""too far for delivery"".  That is pretty strange and frustrating considering we're 10 minutes away, they sent us a menu,  and we order for delivery all the time without issue.  Next, when I expressed confusion the statement was changed to you're ""too far for delivery"" to it's a $30 minimum (our order is pretty consistently around $18).  As the conversation continued the minimum was changed magically to $25. Next she had to check with the driver to see if they ""felt like it "" (they apparently did not).

It's a fast casual type of restaurant so you order at the register, take a number, and the food is brought to you.

I ordered the Bibimbap in the skillet-- the skillet is a must to get the crispy rice. My only complaint on the dish is that my egg was slightly overcooked-- I think this was my fault because I didn't find it and break into it right away. It was covered with gochujang sauce, which is the tastiest of Asian hot sauce condiments. Overall, the dish was very tasty, filling, and didn't seem super heavy (maybe I'm missing a key ingredient that is horrible for you, but I'm hoping not!).

While eating, a man came around and asked me if he could refill my drink or get me anything else. I really appreciated someone checking in on me after getting my food. When I was done, he also happily cleared my plate for me.

It was a little loud and distracting and I probably should have requested a different table but we have kids too so we understand.

The food is always delicious and the service is typically pretty good regardless of whether it is a packed house or not. Tonight was a totally different story. 
We had a table of three that ordered two apps, two side salads, and a sandwich. It took an hour and fifteen minutes to get our side salads. By that point they were warm and wilted (clearly the kitchen made them but the server never brought them to the table). 
My friend commented on the salads taking so long and the server completely dismissed us and said, ""Well can't you see it's busy?"" We never got offered drink refills and no apology was offered for the poor service. The rest of our food was finally served after the bartender started running tables (which he shouldn't have to do, especially when he had a full bar to serve as well). The food was cold, which again indicates that the kitchen wasn't the problem.
We asked for our bill as soon as our food arrived. We were given the check immediately, but no one ever came back to the table to actually cash us out or ask how our food was.
Meanwhile, tables around us were getting frustrated and airing their same complaints about the service. We finally walked to the bar and paid directly after over 2 hours at the pub.
We watched a group of people walk out because the service was that bad. I hate to see one of my favorite places completely fall apart like this. Clearly there is both a management and server issue.

I ordered the Smoked chicken burrito which had bacon, plantains and chipotle crema.  BF got the shrimp, smoked garlic/onion, crispy chicken skin & jalapeno burrito.  Our server asked if we wanted them as a platter with rice and beans.  FOR FIVE DOLLARS EXTRA.  For real??  Are these magic beans???  No thanks.  The plate came with a shredded red cabbage and radish salad which was untouched on both of our plates.  How bout leave off that cabbage nonsense and just give us rice and beans?  The burrito was not your typical gargantuan size, (ala Cantina or most Mexican spots) but instead two thinner burritos... more like rolled tacos.  This was nice for sharing, we each got to try one half and were pretty full.  I actually enjoyed the shrimp one better, the crispy chicken skin was a nice complement to the smoky flavors.

After hearing amazing reviews from friends that whose culinary judgement we trust, we decided our last hurrah breakfast was going to be here. We were honestly overwhelmed with our choices and had no idea which route to take. So - he got the breakfast Mexican Sandwich and I got the Biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. We also both got a small mimosa. 

Let's start with the mimosa. It was really good, but honestly - it's the size of 3 normal mimosas. And it's served with ice... interesting. Not bad - just interesting. 

I tried his breakfast Mexican sandwich. The bread... Ohhhh the bread. It was the better choice of our two selections. Very flavorful and the bread is just - well it's almost croissant like. Almost.

The biscuit skillet with spicy gravy. Let's start with the gravy. If you choose the spicy option - it just has a little kick. Not a dropkick - so don't be skurrd. It's called the biscuit skillet, but honestly - I detected not one single bite of biscuit. Maybe they crumbled it up for me into teeny tiny little biscuit bits. I don't know. It was basically a skillet full of tasty slop, but I probably won't get it again.

The atmosphere: We went in on a Sunday for brunch so it was crowded. One of the first things we noticed was that their ""outside seating"" was in the parking lot. No - like... REALLY the parking lot. Just seemed less than restaurant-y. Kind of grimy and dirty... but you get the choice as to whether you want to sit out there or not, so I didn't mark down for that.

When we walked inside to wait - there was definitely a line and a LOT of confusion. There was no one taking names, waitresses and host were seating people. We did get seated rather quickly, but there was a lot of apologizing and shifting as we hovered over the table next to the front door.

I'm sure we'll be back at some point - but there was a lot of hype to build this place up and in my opinion, it was good.... Just not OMG!!!",2015-09-23 23:01:40,0.57952493,-0.9486271,0.36319664

First off, this place is pretty overpriced. $7 for a small cone of soft serve and cubes of cake is hardly a good value. I'm not sure if I'm able to fully judge the desert, I got a curated chocolate flavored cone that was supposed to come with chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake, and chocolate ganache. There was no ganache in or on the cone, which probably would have helped overall. 

The dessert is sold in a cheap, fragile clear plastic cone. I suppose this is for Instagram users, but I would assume most of these people would be concerned about the massive amount of garbage this is creating, for no benefit other than AESTHETIC. This aesthetic would be served better by serving the dessert in a glass reusable container that doesn't crack in your hand under a slight bit of pressure. 

This establishment would do well to invent something portable, cheap and delicious to house the dessert if they don't want to use glass. I'm imagining maybe throwing waffle batter in a really flat griddle, made fresh for the customer, and rolling it into a cone shape while it's still malleable. You could call this thing a ""waffle cone"". If the staff is overwhelmed, maybe the dessert curator could come in and make them while the severs fill them...",2018-09-17 03:19:56,0.031604357,-0.7508996,0.3915448

I hosted a group of 30+ people here and they were very accommodating to all my room changes and additions even before we got to the hotel. From the moment I checked in, I felt like I was going to be taken care of. I got upgraded to the concierge level, and while the room wasn't all that special, the shower had a couple of extra shower heads, and I could have stayed there all day. I had a great view of the city as well. The concierge level is probably the best one in the entire brand. Spacious, great breakfast selection, and friendly staff. There were several little alcoves if you wanted to have a semi-private meeting.

All of my attendees enjoyed staying here as well. They liked their rooms and the staff treated each of them like VIPs. We were here during the NFL Combine weekend, and even with the NFL coaches there, we got great, attentive service. They loved the location too, close to everything either by walking or a short cab ride. And cabs are lined up around the block so it was never a problem to get one. 

The lobby lounge is amazing, Lots of comfortable seating, big bar, great drinks, nice people, really everything you could want in a hotel lounge. 

The gym is also amazing. It's on the 2nd floor with wall to wall windows. Lots of cardio machines (but at peak times may be all taken), and lots of weight machines. It's like a mini 24 hour fitness. Pool looked nice, didn't use, might be ok to get some laps in. 

For our event we had an evening reception one night and a breakfast meeting on another day. The evening reception went really well and the staff was very accommodating to all of my requests. Food was great, only problem was I didn't order enough, but they remedied that for me. Bartender didn't seem like she wanted to be there, especially when we asked to keep the bar open another 1/2 hr., but it was the only downside of the night. 

Breakfast was great as well. Eggs, potatoes, biscuits and gravy, bagels, the whole spread was fantastic. And again, very helpful with serving drinks and making sure we were all taken care of. 

I usually stay at the Conrad when I'm in town, but this is a fantastic backup option when the Conrad is full or when I have a large, fun group in town. I highly recommend hosting your next event here.",2012-03-03 05:57:19,-1.1266801,0.6942307,-0.6389745

Upon walking in, John and I were greeted by the host and asked how many were in our party. Our 2 guests had not arrived yet and so we were very clearly told that it was their policy to not seat guests until all of the party arrived. Fine by me. We went to the bar to wait. However, we saw two people being seated behind us with four menus on the table. I thought it was against their policy to do that? It definitely put me off. If they were special guests, I guess I understand, but why would you be so up front to tell us about this policy if the policy doesn't apply to everyone?

Anyway.

We were very pleased with this place. We were staying at a hotel near the convention center, and we twice wanted food and a drink at 1 or 2 in the morning without the drunken bar scene. Surprisingly enough, Howlin' Wolf was able to supply us with this on a Thursday and a Saturday, as the music venue component seems to be offset from the open air kitchen and bar set up.

We easily got seats at the bar, and the bartender was friendly and fast with her service. The chef cooked up (well, fried up for the most part) our orders extremely quickly and soon enough we were munching on some unhealthy eats.

The fries were awesome. I've had them with cheese and then with cheese and bacon, and each time they were LOADED with the respective toppings. I was a big fan of the baconed version because they didn't use bacon bits or inappropriately sized slices of the meat. Instead, there was chopped up and shredded bits of greasy bacon permeating the entire dish. It seemed like the cheese and fries were also soaked in grease, but that might be a bit hopeful.

The fried pickles were also phenomenal. It was my first time partaking in such an interesting dish, so maybe I don't have the most refined fried pickles palette, but they were THE BOMB. Slather 'em in ranch and enjoy.

The food provides nutrients, which is the best I can say on that front.  The pizza is usually sub par and I've had two appetizers that were still partially frozen. On the plus side the food usually comes out quickly. 

There are so many tables packed into this place that half of media could be wiped out if there was a tragic accident. This creates a cramped, loud atmosphere. Keeping with the duality theme of this review, this place is great for kids.

So good. 4 course meal (plus bread) for $35 each, plus tax and tip. If I had to do it again, I'd choose the Tarte de Legumes, the Saumon, and the Tart Tatin. Also, good-sized portions on everything! Not tiny little fancy portions.

FOOD:
--Delicious little warm rolls, served with an awesome pesto.

--First course is a ""creamy truffle wild mushroom soup""...those of us who got it were delighted. It was delicious if not a little weird-looking...Due to allergies, one in our party got a split pea and ham soup and the other a tomato red pepper bisque. Kudos to them for having substitutions (the waiter explained it's their vegetarian option as the mushroom one is no longer vegetarian), and both enjoyed their soups, but I personally didn't really like either of them.

--Appetizer (8 options): We had the Calamars, the Tarte de Legumes, the Tartare, and the Salade Boston. I had the ""sustainably-harvested calamari stuffed with house-made provençal sausage, fresh herbs, saffron rice, piperade, jus de legumes""...I don't know why but I was expecting your more usual fried calimari, and I'm not a huge fan of fresh seafood, so I didn't particularly care for it. The other two who had it absolutely loved it though. I also tried the ""Tarte de Legumes: roasted eggplant caviar, caramelized onion, and red pepper tart with black olive and goat cheese tapenade, herb sauce, poached Sandy Ridge Farm egg"" and WOW was it delicious. The runny yolk, the tapenade was delicious, and the tart was a little mini cookie-but-not-a-cookie kind of phylo dough thing, a nice accompaniment, as was the bit of greens it was served with. The ""Tartare: fresh Scottish salmon, mango, basil, capers, black olives, cornichons, tomato, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and wonton crisps"" was apparently good, but was being eaten by a tartare conoisseur (6/10 on her scale). She said ""It had bigger chunks of salmon than a standard tartare, which makes it a little fishier tasting."" The salad (""Boston bibb lettuce with crumbled gorgonzola cheese, apple, walnut pralines, and walnut vinaigrette"") was well received: a sweet little salad. My only note on the salad is that it's not a real leafy salad. A couple large leafs of lettuce topped with the other stuff. Fancy salad.

--Main course (8 options): We had the lamb (Agneau), steak (Bavette), scallops (Vol au Vent), and salmon (Saumon). The lamb was oh so tender, literally fall-off-the-bone. Even after removing all the fat/skin, there was plenty of meat for a good-sized entree. The mashed potatoes were also awesome. Carrots were fine, but I didn't notice any turnips. My friend had the steak and loved it, although we noted it was rather lukewarm if not on the cold side. She liked her mashed sweet potatoes and the green beans too. I personally, having tried all the dishes, would say this one was the least special, although still good. I think my favorite was the salmon (""Saumon: pistachio and goat cheese-crusted Scottish salmon filet wrapped in phyllo, carrot purée, creamy Swiss chard, light turmeric and cumin sauce""), although I can't say I tasted the goat cheese. It was just delicious salmon in delicious buttery phyllo. And finally, the scallops (""Vol au Vent: butter-poached scallops in puff pastry with creamy Swiss chard and saffron mussel sauce"") were delicious as well. The sauce they pour over it (table-side) is a sauce made with cream and the juice that the scallops and mussels cook in. It was heavenly. The scallops aren't literally in the puff pastry. It's a puff pastry in the middle (my friend wished the pastry hadn't been soaked as it got soggy, so maybe ask your waiter to pour around it), with 4 good-sized scallops around it and lots of different little vegetables (I want to say I stole some okra off her plate but I could be completely wrong) that get drowned in the delicious sauce. Yum.

--Dessert (4 options): We tried all except the profiteroles: the St. Tropez Cake (""double-layer valhrona chocolate mousse cake with crème anglaise""), the Tart Tatin (""warmed French caramelized apple tart a la mode""), and the Creme Brulee (""caramelized vanilla bean flan""). The cake was our least favorite by far. The bottom is like a spongy cake, and is not texturally-appealing, although the mousse part on top is good. Would not order it again. The Tart Tatin was delicious, although they were out of ice cream, so we got fresh whipped cream instead. I also wish it had been served a little warmer than it was (it was room temp), but it was just a simple little apple tart. Not too sweet, just simple. And the creme brulee was well executed.

SERVICE:
Our waiter was awesome. Funny and friendly and knew the menu very well. Asked us if we needed anything at a couple points throughout the meal. Water was always filled. My only complaint is the lady who seated us was cloyingly polite, it was annoying.

I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, I tend not to when there's a casino involved but I've learned to let my bf enjoy gambling while I enjoy sleep. One of the things I really liked was the landscape video slideshow, lots of Costa Rica footage which coincidentally is where my girl friends and I will be vacationing soon! Not to mention slides of Seattle which is where I'm pining to live. The large tvs are everywhere in the hotel/casino, it gives you something to look at while in line for the buffet, waiting for someone or when people watching isn't enough. We skiied for 2 days out of our 4 day trip and the Mt Rose shuttle picked us up directly in front of the hotel (in an airport shuttle, FYI: the REAL airport shuttle says Peppermill on it!) One of the first nights, we wandered around and found the bar across Biscotti's with music and singers, those singers can sing! I loved the rendition of Tainted Love. The trumpet player could use a little practice though, his playing was over powering and choppy when I think he meant to compliment the song with accents. The bar stocked Yamazaki whiskey which has been a fun find for my bf. The Island Buffet was ok, I wouldn't stand in line for it again, although there were a ton of various crab dishes and crab legs available. The spa was AMAZING.

First of all, the kim chee. I have absolutely no idea what they brought to the table, and I decided that I'm ok with that. It all tastes good. They bring a lot of little plates, and they are very happy to bring more as you finish stuff off.

They have both tables with grills and tables without. If you get a table without, don't bother ordering meat for them to cook in the kitchen, go for the meals that come in a hot stone bowl. If you do have a grill, and order meat, they are not stingy. You will get more than enough to eat.

The decor is spare, and kind of grim. Not much on the walls, and the chairs are uncomfortable.

Although pricey, we were hapy to find a new place to make it a regular in our list of restaurants.  The food for the family is below:
 
Japanese Mojito: 5 Stars.  Refreshing and not too stiff!  I probably could have had many of these, but stuck with one.

3 piece Dumpling Soup: 2 Stars.  Bland, dumplings I could find anywhere, did not finish.

Mango Soft Shell Crab Salad:  5 Stars.  The best food of the night.  The description is Mango, Crab Meat, Seaweed Salad, Lettuce, Avocado Salad and Masago on the Bottom, Whole Soft Shell Crab on Top.  This could have been a meal by itself.  Extremely tasty and just the right amount of sizzling crab on top with an amazing sauce.

Duck Rolls: 4 Stars.  Wonderful with no grease taste - Deep Fried Roasted Duck and Taro Finished with Sweet Soy and Honey Wasabi Sauce.  I expected duck meat pieces, but it was more of a hamburger meat texture.  Still, very tasty!

I Phone 4S Roll: 3 Stars.  Felt like it was warmer-than-room temperature which was a bit off putting.  Also, I had so much food that I probably did not enjoy it as much as I should have.  Crunchy Spicy Crab with Seared Sea Scallop on top.  

Teriyaki Bento Box Salmon:  3 Stars.  Comes with Salad, Soup, Rice, California Roll, Shrimp Tempura, Shumai, Fruit.  Wife said there was too much tempura in the box with the vegetables, and did not finish it.  However, the salmon was very tasty, and she did not like the California Roll.  Fruit was 1/2 an orange.  The tempura shrimp was really nice, though.

Overall, it came to $96 for 2 adults and 1 kid including tip, so for lunch this was expensive!  There are a lot of choices, so I'll be back to try others.  They have a hibachi on the one side which I'd like to try, too.  To-Kai also has 6 party tray specials from $34 to $80 for catering!

I typically wander in the doors on weekend mornings to get a few hours of studying in, but I have been during the week and it seems to be much more busy.   The customers range from small book clubs, normal people grabbin a quick coffee to Jeff med students grinding away.  

I typically sit at a large table in the back although sometimes it's too busy and I'm stuck at a small table (I like to spread things out).

The restaurant itself is really cute - gelato in the front, pizza (party!) in the back. Lots of space, classy decor, and I'm always a fan of seeing the actual open fire pizza grill. It was also very bright, which was a nice change from the dim lighting that I think so many places are embracing these days - my parents didn't need to use their cell phones as mini flashlights to read the menu, which is always a promising sign!

Service was a lovely mix of attentive without being overbearing, and our server was incredibly pleasant. When he noticed that most of us were vegetarians (he heard me make a vegetarian-related comment while we were ordering) he made sure to tell us which items were made with chicken stock, and offered to bring us lard-free bread, which isn't their normal recipe. I so appreciate that kind of recognition and sensitivity to our eating habits.

The menu itself is really generous - a handful of apps/snacks, some salads, a soup, a few pasta options, and probably 15 kinds of pizza! Plus a really extensive beer/wine/cocktail list. We opted for the arancini, the eggplant ""meatballs,"" the house salad, two pizzas, and a calzone. The starters were really good - both the arancini and the ""meatballs"" had four little fried balls per serving, which were very tasty, but not super filling, and the house salad was also solid - I liked the addition of a few crispy fried onions on top. 

My parents and I were able to comfortably share two pizzas - we went with the Tartufello and the Genovese. Both were really yummy with unique flavors, and despite having a plethora of ingredients, neither one felt heavy - like we could eat a lot without needing to be rolled out of the restaurant (#winning). But...like some other reviewers have said, the pizza literally feels wet. The middle of the pies were both soaking, for lack of a better term. The crust has no holding capacity, and we really needed to use a knife and fork to eat the ""tip half"" of the pizza - once you get closer to the crust, you can pick it up, normal style. I don't think this necessarily made the pizza bad...but it was a bit strange. I'm sure that this really is the authentic style that they're going for, but it might be nice to give diners a heads-up at some point during the meal that this consistency is normal.

Although I didn't have gelato on this visit because Philly is currently the same temperature as the Arctic Circle, I've had Capogiro gelato at other locations and it is truly drool-worthy, so I know it's a deadly combination to have it offered under the same roof as tasty pizza. Overall, this place is worth a visit - just prepare yourself for the pizza :)

(Note: After writing this review, I actually researched ""wet"" pizza, and turns out, authentic Neapolitan pizza is soggy in the center and usually can't be ""hand held."" So, lo and behold Capofitto knows just what they're doing and this style of pizza is totally a thing! Mangia!)",2016-02-12 16:21:44,0.036467105,0.2490432,-0.28216553

I literally eat at the Tap 3-4 times a week (its the place that everyone at my work can agree on) and I have never had a bad experience.  I am a huge soccer fan so I appreciate the fact that I can go someone in the city and actually watch the games ""live"".  Plus, it is funny to see the look on people's faces who walk in expecting a sports bar and can't believe that the place is filled with soccer fans (yes, they do exist in the United States and our numbers are growing).  I left my laptop bag here once as well on accident and the servers immediately put it behind the bar and secured it for me so I appreciate their genuine concern and attention to detail.  

When I am feeling unhealthy, I'll go with the burger or the reuben (light on the cheese).  On days where I am counting calories, I elect to go with either the hummus or the side salad so I don't have to engage in self-flagellation when I count my calories at the end of the day.  Really the only thing negative that I have to say about the whole place is that the owner through some misguided choice in life is apparently a Manchester United fan.  Since this is beyond my rational ability to process, I choose to engage instead in a healthy amount of denial when frequenting his establishment (the fact that he isn't obnoxious about it helps a lot too since he is apparently a better man than I).",2011-08-05 18:23:16,-0.24220043,0.30841482,-0.3593834

I had the #46 steak and flank pho, we shared spring rolls, he had some kind of spicy Thai influenced soup with a variety of meats and hollow noodles. 

Glows:
Clear, fairly flavorful broth.
Good texture noodles.
Tender meat.
Fresh sprouts, jalapeños, Thai basil.
Clean space and appealing decor.
Friendly service.
Reasonably priced.

Grows:
Spring rolls were just okay, and had an odd meat flavor. (Fake crab meat?) 
Pho Broth could have been more complex and flavorful.
His soup was lukewarm, not supposed to be. 
The awkward string curtain by the ladies bathroom clings to everyone and gets stuck in the doorway.

It was an entire onion, sautéed with mushrooms, and drenched in what seemed to be canned marinara... What chili ? The stem that was at one end of the skillet ?? Or the slight hint of spice with an overwhelming taste of spaghetti sauce? It was all over the place, and I obviously missed their ""concept"" of that dish. I guess I liked their rice. My friend's Carne Asada tacos were really dry, that even her 6 year old complained about it. We liked their salsa...

On my first visit, I shared the short rib & cheddar duck fat fries, the village burger and the kentucky hot brown with the boyfriend. All of that was amazing.

Since it was highly rated and seemed intriguing, we decided to come here with our group of friends. With the exceptional food here, my curiosity was piqued and ended up looking it up and was pleasantly surprised to find out it was owned by Chef Jose Garces. 

On our most recent visit, we had to order the duck fat fries topped with short ribs & cheddar sauce again to share. We both each ordered the village burger. I had mine topped with bleu cheese & an egg. He got the caramelized onions & cheddar on his. We both ordered our burgers medium. It was still quite moist but I think this burger might be best medium rare. The egg in my burger was perfectly cooked. I was expecting the yolk to be quite messy and runny when I sliced my burger in half but was pleasantly surprised that it kept intact.

Their curry and coconut infused flavors in their food are REAL authentic Thai ingredients, not that nonsense from a jar. Literally the real deal and no shortcuts.

I wished they gave more soup than a ton of noodles (I just felt like I ate more noodle carbs than anything) because the soup base was fragrant and addicting. For the price of $14-$15 for that big bowl, you think it's worth it. It kind of is... but maybe next time I need to ask for more soup and cut back on the carbs. Then, it would be worth it. I guess I also wish they could have a little more variety and other choices with the food selection. One day, hopefully the menu can expand.

You don't get that kind of customer focused service anymore.  The jeans are by no means inexpensive, but I'd rather pay a lot of money for a high quality piece that is American made that I will wear for many years than to pay a fraction of that for something that will wear quickly & be disposed of next season.  Plus, I'd rather spend $$$ at a small business such as this one than give places like Urban Outfitters a single dime of mine.  This denim is of much higher quality than you are going to find at a chain store's mass produced brand, so it really isn't a comparison, and the fit is very solid, like a pair of old 501s.

This restaurant is located in what appears to be a converted train station also attached to the building is the museum.  They have valet, but they also have a ton of convenient parking nearby.  At first we were confused between the bistro/market and the actual more upscale looking restaurant... mostly because the bistro looks like it has AMAZING food in a casual environment.  However, the restaurant was fantastic and has ambiance in comparison.  We were a table of four and each tried something different - burger, filet, bistro steak and house special pasta.  ALL of us were thrilled with our meals.  I had also ordered the mixed green salad which was truly delicious - and I don't normally say that about salads.  I also tried their house Sangria which is worth going back for.  (they apparently switch from white wine to red wine on their Sangria at the start of fall)  My favorite thing about the meal was the dessert.  I went with the creme brulee which had this homemade cookie and berries with it.  Not all creme brulee's are created equal and this one is way ahead of the pack in terms of what I have tasted over my lifetime.  We would return for sure.  The location was really cool, as well as the atmosphere, prices were reasonable, the food outstanding.  While I can't get as excited about the service we had - I would say it was 'good'.

My sister and I sat at the bar and ordered the Korean fried chicken, hoedeopbap, titan roll and nemo roll. 

The Korean fried chicken are some of the best I've had. Though We got the spicy option,  it wasn't as spicy as I'd hope, however the owner said they could definitely make it spicier for us. Totally accommodating, I love it! Side note, if you plan to order these, be sure to order these first and early on bc they take a while to make. But it's worth the wait. The crispness of the skin and juiciness of the chicken is to die for. 

The hoedeopbap is a bowl of rice with assorted raw fish, cucumbers, lettuce, and carrots with a side of spicy sauce. Warning. The bowl is HUGE! This is definitely a meal in itself. It's a very light and refreshing bowl. We had to take most of this home since we were too stuffed on everything else. 

The titan roll and Nemo roll were both delicious rolls packed with flavors. Again, these rolls are also huge so be prepared to take two bites or stuff it all in one, either way, you won't be disappointed. 

Aside from the huge projected tv screen on the wall, one of the other many cool parts of this modern restaurant is that they have a sauce bar. All the sauces you can imagine.

Nice, fresh and well prepared tapas, friendly staff, tasty drinks and amazing atmosphere.

Gulf fish Cevice: excellent. Fish well prepared. The blend  of the sweet mango with the herbs and fish really bring this cevice to life. Too bad that dish (and that's my only complain) was way over-salted.

Pork belly: cooked to perfection. delicate (not oily) and well seasoned.

Lamb sliders: perfect patty seasoning and great tomatoes puree.
but the best of all tapas was....
The shrimps tempura. bit sour, bit sweet, crunchy, perfectly cooked.it's a modern version of the tempura where the shrimps are not deep fried but the crush is actually spread over the shrimps. EXCELLENT.
Fries are fries.

The convention center area is big and bright and well organized. I appreciated that the elevators were divided into 2 sections, for mid-rise and high-rise floors. My room was comfortable and quiet, and I had a beautiful view to the west.

I only wish the day-to-day operations of the hotel were up to the quality of the convention center itself.

The swimming pool in this hotel is unusually small. The ""rationale"" for that is that it's a convention hotel. Yet they do go out of their way to advertise the pool. 

The staff here are ""message happy"" in terms of leaving messages on your phone, and if it's a message from the hotel, it won't just go away upon playing it. In that case, you have to call guest services. The first message was in regard to me. The hotel room was not in my name, but I was listed as also in the room. The hotel wanted to know how to handle any incidentals I might purchase. That, to me, seemed ridiculous. Then any day I did not request maid service, there was ANOTHER message, notifying me that I didn't get maid service (perhaps it was because I had the sign on the door?) reminding me that I could request it. I don't require maid service every day, and I went without 3 different days. You guessed it, 3 different messages, one each time, and they don't always turn the light off after that... the important phrase you have to learn to use is ""Can you please mark the message as delivered?""

It would have been nice if there were a way to turn off the light on the temperature control. It's quite bright at night, I had to cover it with a towel. 

Parking is way too expensive. The fee for on-site parking was $43/day. I then learned that the parking fee for cars for the SAME GARAGE, if you were in some of the other hotels in the complex, such as Spring Hill, was less (e.g., $30/day). We wound up parking our car offsite at a lot a half-mile away, for $14/day, with free in/out privileges and a complimentary (plus tips) shuttle. 

If you're going to stay here, particularly for a convention, do a lot of homework in advance, because that may save you a bundle of money.",2018-07-09 23:06:17,-1.4548222,0.44593045,-1.3128427

It has a neat atmosphere of being ""in school"" or ""library"".  The water jugs on the table look like old time scotch or brandy bottles.  My son, who is 5, was having a moment and refused to eat anything on their children's menu.  Our waitress, Audrey, was really sweet and contacted the head chef who actually came to our table.  He didn't want our son to go hungry so he asked my son what he wanted and my son said a grilled cheese.  The head chef went back to the kitchen and made it for my child and then hand delivered it.  I realize a grilled cheese is not that hard to do but since it wasn't on the children's menu, it was a special order.  He completely related to my 5 year old and he ended up eating the whole sandwich.  And they didn't charge us for it at all!  Had Audrey not done that, we wouldn't have had that experience.  It was really cool for both our waitress and the chef to take that extra time to support my crazy child.

As for the adult meals, I had the burger with the Gouda and bacon.  It was cooked perfectly!!  And I had the fried zucchini strips.  The dipping sauce was so good!  It was peppery and flavorful.  My husband had the burger with the fried egg.  Also cooked perfectly and delicious.  He also got the loaded tots.  They were crispy and not overloaded with cheese so they stayed crispy, not soggy.

Gripes:  Parking.  I never even try to park in the front lot anymore.  I either walk to WaWa, or if I am driving, I park in the back lot.  Yes, WaWa has a second lot, behind the store.  Almost always an open spot.  Often times, there is 5-10 open spots back there.  

Gripes continued:  Often there are panhandlers.  Not really WaWa's fault, I mean we are talking Germantown Ave, in Philadelphia proper, it is a reality.  There have not been any aggressive panhandlers since 2014, so this is not a concern really any longer.

Major points for:  
*seasonal specialties!  I look forward to autumn for the pumpkin cannoli dip and chips!  I also dig the apple cider donuts and to a lesser degree the pumpkin donuts.  
*Prices!  Everything is reasonable!  Some stuff is cheap!
*Selection!  Good choice for candy, chips, snacks, healthy snacks/protein bars, drinks, etc.
*For the MASSIVE VOLUME that the store does, the lines usually move very fast and efficiently, and 2nd registers open up lightning fast when they are needed!
*The store is clean from my point of view.  It is a busy, busy store, but I never see any mess on the floor or coffee station or food station.

I do not eat any of the hot food.  Low quality, I steer clear.  


For a convenience store that is open 24 hours, WaWa is awesome!  

Does this one have a bathroom?  I never used it, I never checked....but maybe there is no bathroom for customers there!  Maybe it is around back?  Hmmm.  I would avoid using it anyway.  
Also, this WaWa could never have gas pumps, traffic is already congested between Allens Lane and Mt. Airy Avenue along Germantown Ave.  (Between WaWa and the Bank of America on the corner.)

I mean, they have nachos, but Tavern's come with pistachio and goat cheese. Nice! 

I'd easily return on a non game day (or even to sit on the shaded side patio) for more of that White Trash Hash. Think tater tot casserole. I mean, really. Goodbye hangover.

We both had dim sum, mine only mildly spicy and his quite spicy, and both enjoyed our dishes.

They were very accommodating with setting us up as a group and when we wanted to enjoy some champagne after our services. 
My only issue would be the fact that they do not have showers or a separate room to change in. Since the rooms are only separated by curtains you felt like you could be seen by others next to you. Plus the fact that if someone walked by the breeze blew the thin curtains making you duck for cover. The sheet on the massage table felt heavy and oily like it had not been washed between people.

I've been here a bunch of times now for sit-down lunch and really enjoy it (the front is just a counter, but the sit-down part is in the back).  Very small, casual, laid-back dining area (but nice).  The servers are always really friendly.  The place always smells fabulous (obviously).  I'd say the prices are generally ""reasonable.""  Most of their food has a ""home-made"" taste to it.  Their hummus is very yummy, and I always get a grilled cheese sandwich, which sounds simple, right?  Oh no, my friend...  the bread they use, which i *think* is honey-wheat, is simply out of this world.  Maybe it's just me... but that there's a tastey sangwich.

OK, now about those desserts... Obviously, the ice cream is yummy.  duh.  Their apple pie looks horrific, but from what I've heard, it's amazingly good.  The main thing to know is that their portion sizes border on obnoxious.  So, either bring a friend and share, or make a dessert your main entree.  Cause ain't nobody gon' eat dat much.  It's kind of annoying, too, because it's not like you can take it home with you... (well, i guess you could... but wouldn't it get all runny and melty and gross?).  My fave is the brownie sundae.  Good God, ya'll... 

Two complaints:
1)  I noticed that the food (not the dessert food, just the foody food) tends to take forever to come out.  I know it's because everything is made to order and cooked right there in front of you in the kitchen, which is nice and all, but if you're in a bit of a hurry, as I am when I'm on my lunch break, you may get held up and a little annoyed.

2) Horrible music on the speakers.  Last time we went, it was a bunch of Cher techno-remixes, and the time before that, en entire CD of Jennifer Lopez.  Not that it's blasting or anything.... but still annoying.

Those two complaints may just be coincidental... things that only seem to happen when I'm there.",2007-06-06 00:35:49,0.07813025,0.3897334,0.3038939

There's a split menu - Texas and Mexican food. My usual is the BBQ sandwich with fries and cole slaw from the Texas menu. It's a huge portion of BBQ and I usually cannot eat all of it. The cole slaw is great, too. Fries are hit or miss - sometimes they're loaded with really salty seasoning to the point that they're not really palatable. The $1 chips and salsa is great and the salsa has a smokey flavor to it. Service at the tables is average. We usually (and prefer to) sit at the bar, which is easy enough to do with just two people.

I always try seafood gumbo where ever it is served because my grand father was the Executive Chef for the Fountain Blue Hotel in New Orleans and Chef at the St. Charles Hotel back in the day.  His gumbo set the standard both chicken and seafood, des Familles gumbo is very close with real whole shrimp and lump crab meat.

For the main entree I really enjoy their lightly fried seafood platter with a dirty rice that includes sweet corn in the mix.  My wife doesn't like it because of the corn.  I do because it is a different take an an old food item.  I also have had very good Catfish Almandine, Catfish Foster (very rich) and the Redfish Marcel (a bit pricey).  It is hard to choose when we go, which is usually on Friday nights, about 5:30pm to beat the crowds.

I know it is not wine, but beer goes with seafood my friends.

Upon entrance, the space is truly open and fun, with games (such as chess) and flowers on tables, and of course a bar. It's just so open and beautiful minimalist space. There is also a small second floor area for viewing.

Check out this location for the live music, it's simply amazing and may even get you encouraged to get a little dance in yourself. Drinks are good, people are wonderful, and music phenomenal.

So yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.

I decided to get the one-meat plate with ""wet"" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,

We both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze.

I really wish I could give a higher rating, but based on the food, I wouldn't call myself a fan.

He then opted for the falafel gyro wrap, while I ordered the vegetarian banh mi. His wrap was undoubtedly the best part of the meal; the smoky tomato relish and caramelized onions were a wonderful compliment to the delicately spiced fritters; I do wish that the vegan version came with a soy yogurt substitute. My banh mi, on the other hand, was a disappointment. With every bite , I kept getting a gritty taste.The tofu was flavorless and the only dominant flavors that I got were from the very long stems of cilantro (which should have been chopped) in the sandwich. We decided to round of our meal with the vegan hazelnut toffee basket. When it was first brought to our table; we were impressed by the presentation. However, it did not taste as good as it looked. The problem with the dish was that it was one-dimensional. It just tasted sugary. I really wished for another flavor to balance the sweetness.

The setup is the same as other places like FroYo and Red Mango, so my strategy still remains the same. You have to go fruity or chocolatey. I decided on fruity and tried out their peach, blueberry, raspberry, mango and vanilla flavors. I liked peach and raspberry best, but the best part was that the toppings you add at the end were all fresh! They have the fruits: blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, pineapples, etc. And the also have all the other normal toppings like nuts and whip cream and syrups.

I heard a radio commercial & picked up tickets to the Halestorm (preceeded by Eve to Adam & In This Moment) show a couple weeks ago while I was up there. So, for the good & bad...
Venue floorplan is HORRIBLE! It's long and narrow, which means the majority of attendees cannot even get a glimpse of the stage. I know I don't go to concerts to watch it on a tiny little TV screen. The first floor is so crowded that once in the door, it was a bear trying to get to the bar. The bartenders were so rude, too! The Over-21 lounge upstairs looked nice. But, again, good luck trying to see anything.  I was lucky, though.

I was wary of the Yelp reviews because they are all so glowing, but I was not disappointed. It's rare to find a repair place that gives it to you straight and doesn't try to screw you over with pricing and unnecessary repairs. I am even more sensitive to this as I don't have the first clue about cars so I put 100% of my trust in to people like this. 

I came to Keith's with one major problem and 7-8 minor issues with my Nissan Murano. They went above and beyond in terms of getting everything taken care of in an efficient and cost-effective manor. From the moment I walked in the door, they were trying to save me money. For example, they did not charge me for a tire rotation because I needed my brakes replaced. They rushed the parts they needed over to the shop and stayed an hour after closing time to get my major issue fixed. Unfortunately, the problem was bigger than what they had anticipated, so I was back in the shop when they opened the next morning. Now whether this bigger problem was missed the day before or would have been missed regardless, I don't know. But they took the time the next day (4 hours) to comb through the entire car and make sure everything was in place and working properly. 

I would say that by going to Keith's rather than the dealership (my usual go-to for everything car-related), I saved at least $1000, if not more. My side mirror got knocked off - the dealership was going to charge me $400 to replace it, Keith's is doing it for $150. My key fobs stopped working - the dealership was going to charge me $120 PER FOB, Keith's is doing it for $100 for both. I originally took my car in for a horrible noise it was making - the dealership was going to charge me $150 just to put it on the rack and take a look, Keith's charge is $18. These are just examples of some of the cost-savings I got at Keith's.

I will definitely be going back. And I'll be disappointed when I move away from New Orleans as I'll never find another place like Keith's.",2014-03-15 15:48:01,-1.8096178,0.028644513,0.64746505

This place is hurting bad for good service and well prepared food. After a long hard week of work all I wanted was a nice night out and to enjoy some good food with my fiance. That sure did not happen! 

1. Took about 5 minutes for a server come to our table one we were seated. (The restaurant was not very busy) 

2. She was not very friendly when she did greet us. We got the feeling we were a bother to her right off the bat. 

3. We ordered the Mediterranean platter as an appetizer and the pita seemed stale or overcooked. It was certainly not soft. 

4. I ordered a side of brown rice with my burger and was brought lentils instead. I pointed it out to the waitress who blamed the cooks and seemed very annoyed with me for pointing out the mistake. First off, maybe the cooks did mix up the order but is it not her responsibility to check the correctness of the order before it's brought to the table? Second, when she did bring me the rice it was hard and crunchy! Completely under-cooked!

5. My fiance ordered the garlic new potatoes to go with his burger and the potatoes were almost all burnt and inedible. The ones that weren't burnt didn't taste like garlic what so ever. He could have sent them back but after the attitude the waitress gave to me he didn't want to. 

6. We were not asked if we would like another round drinks or needed anything else after we had started in on our entrees. And how could we not want more drinks after such a disappointing dining experience? 

I have never had a bad experience here in the past. Food and service have always met my expectations. However, I am not sure I want to return here again anytime soon as it was absolutely not worth the $60+ we spent!

I'd recommend calling him on the way so he knows you are arriving.

We ate a late breakfast before the class and that worked great.  Keep in mind that it takes a while to cook everything, so don't expect to eat until late afternoon.  You don't want to be cooking while you are starving.

That's what Morimoto is for.  Then there are times when you want to stuff your face with big tasty rolls.  That is what Makiman is for. 

Went on Saturday night with a groupon in hand and reservations for 8pm.  I'm not sure that we really needed those reservations, but I'm working towards that big $10 opentable giftcard (after a mere 6 years, I'm about 2/3 of the way there!).  I started with some miso soup and then the spicy tuna tartar.  The tuna tartar was better the last time I dined at Makiman. It wasn't as spicy this time around and I bit into something hard.  I had a moment of omg-what-the-fuck-was-that-some-sort-of-fish-gristle!?!?!?! panic and then realized it was just  a chunk of tempura.  Weird.  Hard chunks do not belong in tuna tartar and I hit 2 of them. Also my plate had a big chip in it.  Ghetto.  Throw out your chipped plates. I sampled my boyfriend's rock shrimp tempura.  It was good but not the best I've had (Zento's is much better).

I ordered two rolls.  The raw viking roll was my favorite.  It was fresh and tasty.  I also had the yellow stallion which was pretty good.  The specialty rolls are HUGE. I was stuffed after dinner. 

Our server was great and the food came out very quickly. I still can't decide if their motto ""Do you like it raw?"" is a double entendre ode to ODB or an unintentionally funny, innocently fobby question. Either way it's pretty amusing.  The sushi at Makiman isn't bad, just not as high quality as some other places.

- Charcuterie Plate
- Crab Cakes (which the server forgot about)
- Grilled Cheese (coworkers ordered two of them, but we didn't try them)

The meatballs were plenty since we were able to share it among my coworkers.  The meatballs were a decent mix of sweet and tangy, but strangely reminded me of a somewhat better version of IKEA's Swedish meatballs.  Charcuterie plate was not bad, but the pate was a bit overwhelming because of its chunky, meatloaf-y consistency (I prefer the spreadable pates).  Prosciutto and two types of pork salami were good.  Definitely ask for more toast points if you decide to order the charcuterie plate because there weren't many to begin with.  Oh, and the wonderful crab cakes that our waitress forgot about... the boyfriend really wanted to try them because it was a Friday special, but I guess we'll have to wait until next time for that.

Drink-wise, I got the Lavender.  I forgot what was in it, but it was ah-mazing!  Very small amount though, might I add, but maybe that's just me.  I inhaled it within minutes (tehehe).  The boyfriend got the pinot noir and that was just okay.

Back to our server forgetting our crab cakes -- she was pretty much in, what seemed to me, a very rushed and 'blah' mood.  Towards the end, she was nowhere to be found and the bartender had to come over and see what else we wanted.  But even he gave off the same vibe, in my opinion.  

I'm not sure if the huge crowd and short of staff working that night had anything to do with the lackluster service, but I will definitely be back again to try other drinks (or get more of the Lavender~) and other hors d'oeuvre!",2013-08-09 04:23:13,-1.283552,0.26462963,-0.27825168

We found it tucked in a little business center across from the Dunkin Donuts in Newtown PA. It is brand new and has taken over the same spot as Mamita's Latino had. It is worth seeking it out if you want to try real deal quality Indian food.
We were seated by a friendly gentleman and fresh papadam (which is a crispy wafer-like cracker/tortilla) and chutneys were brought to the table immediately.

The appetizers we had were Potato Samosas with a delicious tamarind chutney and a biting fresh cilantro chutney. Very crispy and filled with savory potatoes and peas in a crispy wrap.
Both were excellent. 

We also had chili paneer, which really could be an entree. It was as hot as I wanted it to be but still you can tell a deft hand, who knows spices, created this dish (yummy beyond words!) and a we tried an interesting Panipuri. It was  a twist on the typical one you see on the Sunday buffets. This one was filled with crunchy toasted confetti and creamy avocado. Light and refreshing! Perhaps, you can tell my family loves appetizers and it would have been plenty of food if we stopped there but since it was so good we couldn't help but try as many things as our chubby tummies would hold.

Northern Indian food has always been my favorite style of Indian food but it can be heavy.
It seems some restaurants think the more cream and butter the better but Guru's knows how to balance richness without killing all the flavors of the dish. So, being the hungry hungry hippos we are, here are our entrees:
Palak Aloo- which is spicy, smooth spinach and potatoes,
Chili chicken- an Indo Chinese dish that was seasoned to mouth watering perfection ,Kind of like a General Tso's on steroids and spice. It is one of our favorites.
Paneer Makhni- a homemade Indian cheese cube kind of  like a tasty tofu but better.in creamy tomato curried sauce .It's rich and creamy but not drowning in fat like so many other restaurants. The breads are fresh made to order. We found out this place is a BYOB so that certainly is a plus for our next visit. We had mango lassi and,chai tea this time but an Indian beer would be awesome with this meal.

Our tickets had been purchased in advance and we were visiting(from the West Coast) the museum for the first time in 10 years. The mini golf course was loads of fun and laughter until we walked 3 steps back into the building. Then the absurdities began. 

There were 2 people telling me that I had to take by backpack off because of their policies. ""No problem"" I responded as I was merely asking where the restroom was after holding it for over an hour while I was playing golf.

They pointed me in the direction down a long corridor and then as I was pushing the door to the woman's bathroom open, a male security guard rushed towards me asking me about the ""backpack policy."" I said I was informed and was just going to the bathroom...Then, it became ridiculous. Why would he walk towards me as I was walking into the bathroom? 

I was only trying to have a good time on vacation with my son. Then, as we left the bathroom area we went to sit down and decide where we'd go next. We were approached - again - by someone who told us about the backpack policy. This is all after I tried taking it off, hanging it on one shoulder to find that my back pain was returning. Which is why I wear a backpack in the first place. When I explained to him my back pain and bulging disc he walked away and called a manager. 

By this time, we were flabbergasted that this had escalated to the point of calling a manager who turned out to be really nice. He repeated the policy now for a 4th time and mind you - we had not gone anywhere near artwork. We were jusy trying to figure out where to explore next. He offered a stroller or locker. I told him I didn't feel comfortable leaving my credit cards and passport in a locker. Instead, I asked him for a refund and told him that I would leave since I could not just let the backpack hang on my shoulder because of the backpain. He insisted on giving us a stroller for the backpack, which we took. He escorted us down to the area of where the garden tour would begin and then exchanged the stroller for a wheelchair after I overheard him laughing about the situation with a colleague who was handing him the wheelchair.

In the interest of salvaging the day for my son, I decided to stay and take a tour of the gardens. The information desk assistant told us to wait in a certain area for the tour guide who never came.

I recently switched dentists after moving to Saint Louis.  After reading reviews online I picked out Dr. Simokaitis's office.  The experience has been awful.  The woman who runs the front desk is totally incompetent and rude.  I've tried twice now to make an appointment.  The first time I called at 12:55PM, she answered and told me to call back another time, since she didn't want to enroll new patients.  

So I waited a week and called.  Same woman answers, asks for my last name.  I tell her my last name, on which she promptly 'corrects' me, telling me that my own last name is incorrect.  I then ask to make an appointment, upon which she tells me that they're waiting for the mail before they can enroll new patients.  ""Call back some other time.""  

I don't know what is going on in this office, but the staff answering the phones are completely incompetent.  Save your time and go elsewhere...anyplace else.

If you value getting decent customer service or just the ability to make an appointment, avoid this group at all costs.  I'm going to have to file a complaint with the insurer to get out from this dentist.",2014-05-27 18:17:43,-2.2308943,-0.9600919,0.14024912

I have two major issues here though: 1.) The Hard Rock brand in and of itself is an experience for customers, whether or not it's the casino a restaurant or a museum. Therefore, people who work there should be expert enough on the brand and tourist attractions to guide customers and answer basic questions about the primary thing that makes Hard Rock a brand: the legendary items and artifacts that are the basis of the business. No one who worked there could direct us to any of the artifacts we were looking for. Not even the two people at the information desk. That's really a disadvantage to the organization and lessens the enjoyment for the customer if they have to walk all around the casino to look for a picture of Prince or Patti LaBelle's dress. They need to have some sort of manual or chart that documents where things are and the workers need to be trained on it too. 2.) my second issue is that their food court absolutely sucks. For this to be such a big casino and such a big tourist attraction, they need to expand their food offerings. There are like 3 food court options and then there's the Hard Rock restaurant, which isn't of interest to lots of people being that the food is mediocre at all of them. I've been to several Hard Rock restaurants across the country and the food is consistently mediocre and chainy.

I feel pretty generous in giving Ted Drewes three stars, but it is just frozen custard. There really is nothing special about it.

I've had it on a few occasions, since I don't really live near Chippewa, but people in St. Louis sure do dig it up. I'm just as content as going to a nearby Fritz' or any other local ice cream/custard stand.

Maybe because I didn't grow up on it, having moved to the area a few years ago, but I don't see what is so special about it. Sure it tastes good, but in my opinion, there is nothing that distinguishes it from anyone else. It's not terrible. It's not great. It's just custard.

That being said, yes, they do provide freebies if you are getting married. My wife and I swung by on our wedding day and they gave out whatever we wanted to our wedding party (and the photographer too). Good thing, since it was the hottest day of 2010.

We were told wait would be 15-25 minutes for 3, at around 7:45 on a Tuesday night. Not bad, but we decided to sit at the bar cause we were starving. 

Bartender was a little distant at first, but seemed to be the same with the others at the bar as well so we didn't take it personally. Ended up warming up to us really nicely though. Chatted with some servers as they came to the bar to deliver food and they were all incredibly friendly. Complementary loaf of the lightest, fluffiest French bread. 

I got the Seared Jumbo Scallops appetizer: $15. Came with a small salad. The scallops were delicious! Flavorful, tender, and cooked to perfection. Practically melted in the mouth. The order came with only 2, but they were huge as promised, and it was only an appetizer after all. 

I decided I needed a little something more, and went with the Soup 1-1-1: $8.50; a combo of their three soups-Gumbo Ya Ya (good, nothing extraordinary, had a little kick; the sausage didn't have too much flavor), Seafood Gumbo (similar to the Gumbo Ya Ya; same kick, both had wild rice in it) and the Soup Du Jour (not exactly sure what it was; yellow-golden color, rich, creamy flavor with shrimp). The Du Jour was the best of the 3, but the trio option was still nice. This came with a loaf of French bread as well. 

Bistro Salad: $9. The vinaigrette was delightful, but the veggies weren't anything special. 

Soft Shell Crab: $34. Delicious!! Looks deceptively brown and shriveled, but almost squirted juices as it was cut. Crab meat was soft; could've been less lightly breaded. The corn bed was perfect; creamy and flavorful, and went nicely with the loaf of French bread.

Panic, panic. 

It's perfect though, their water ice is. That's what I'm tellin you. I know I'm gonna sound like a loon, but their's is a seriously precise consistency of icy slush.

I love, love the pina colada flavor with the tiny pineapple chunks. Delectable! That one's my second favorite flavor of em all. My most favorite of all time, however, is the lemon water ice. 

Italiano's lemon water ice. Tis the best in the land! It's ever so refreshingly lemony. It's evenly sweet and tart and the zest and bits of lemon throughout make it the best damn lemon water ice I ever did slurp...and it's making me a little bit insane that my chances to enjoy it are a dwindlin'. So, this is a gushing review and also a personal call to action that I don't squander this precious water ice time.

I made an appointment a week out for a shampoo, haircut, and nails for our pup D'Ohgee. Its been on the hot side and he was starting to look like a shaggy old man. We arrived a bit early and there was already a line (OK. One person with a small dog, but a line nonetheless). While the woman at the desk was immensely friendly and welcoming, the establishment was not. Yes, its a pet groomer, and pups are inherently chaotic, and the facility seemed designed to promote such chaos. But the haphazard way they were arranged, I initially thought that the rows of dog crated stacked 3 high and lined along the side wall were for sale, Nope. They were semi-permanent (not permanently attached, mind you) containers for temporarily warehousing pets while waiting for their release -- think American prisons. Open pens were scattered around the floor to hold larger dogs. None of this was horrible (dogs, after all), but these probably should be more permanently affixed. This chaos extended to the rest of the facility. I will keep stressing that they are dog groomers, an inherently messy business, but the place was (is?) filthy. I am not sure when the place was last cleaned, but again, since they are dog groomers, It could very well have been yesterday (I am being kind. It would require a debris box). 

But, I did not come for the ambiance, and my dog was not stacked along the wall. He had a nice pen in the middle of the room (little fatty butterpants is probably too wide to fit in a box.
The woman who greeted us was a pleasure to deal with, and the groomer who took care of us, while grumpy from the time she arrived til I left, did a good job with the pooch. Its not a ""boutique"" by any means. But again, since they are dogs, none of them cared about any of this. 

Recommendation: Yes, I will take the pooch there again. To the facility: $40 is a steal. Raise your prices a bit and hire a cleaning service.",2015-09-02 13:21:56,-1.7136596,-0.09227831,-0.07953013

 As I walked into Smiley's Cafe, I was greeted by a gentleman named Smiley. Smiley speaks in third person. He says things like ""Don't worry, Smiley will take care of you."" He noticed I was a newbie to his cafe and recommended his popular selling items. He also let me tried the Taziki sauce that he made himself. It was tangy and had a zing to its flavor. So, I ordered the Chicken Gyro with Taziki sauce and I was very satisfied. 

  As I bit into the gyro for the first time, I could taste the chicken, Taziki sauce, lettuce, onions, and tomatoes all in one bite. The vegetables were very fresh and the tomatoes were cut the right size since I am note a fan of thick slices of tomatoes. So, if you love salad, you should definitely try out the gyro. 

 Pro tip: If you feel that the Taziki sauce is too overpowering, you can ask Smiley to put it on the side. ""Smiley will take care of you.""

 Finally, as a treat I had the strawberry banana smoothie. Real fruits, no powdery stuff here. Great smoothie. 

 Overall, great customer service, friendly staff, and great food makes Smiley's Cafe one of the best places in Philly to get a gyro. Highly recommended, and will be going back for more.",2013-07-19 17:20:18,0.0064829835,-0.81752104,0.17931224

We ordered off their happy hour menu, and the fish tacos and flatbreads were an instant hit, esp. for the price. We ordered four appetizers and six glasses of wine, and our bill was only $36! 

I returned for two more happy hours and remained fairly impressed. However, we noticed with the dipping sauce for the phyllo cigars and arancini, it tasted like a can of Campbell's tomato soup. 

Since we enjoyed their happy hour three times and the ambience, we decided to go there last night on a double date. Our friends ordered the seafood pasta and capellini (in a spicy sauce) entrees. I ordered the lobster ravioli which our server said was one of the most popular dishes, and my husband ordered the special--described to us as a whole white fish in a lemon butter sauce and capellini. 

First off, the capellini appeared to be all pasta but not enough flavor as our friend had to shake so much Parmesan on it. The seafood pasta seemed okay, but the lobster ravioli proved to be underwhelming in portion and taste for $17. My husband's whole fish looked smaller than we had imagined it to be and full of fine bones, and it tasted bland. He had to reach for salt to make it somewhat more tolerable. Also, his side included asparagus, not capellini as described to us. 

Oh, and the bread basket strangely does not include butter but only a low grade of olive oil without Parmesan at first. The Parmesan arrived only with the pasta entrees. 

We had purchased the $35 for $60 Groupon, and our bill was $96. This also included a glass of wine, two iced teas, and a soda. The final total was $36. It still seemed too much for the bland taste and portions. 

While the ambience looks tasteful, the entrees were not. It did not make me want to return for another forgettable, overpriced dinner. My advice is skip dinner and only go for the happy hour from 4-7 during the week.",2016-08-14 13:29:37,0.47828016,-0.78832155,-0.32823694

What a mistake. I picked up an order of meat samosas, pakoras, chicken tikki masala, and a side of raita. My first complaint is that the prices that they have listed on their site are definitely outdated. Those items together came to almost $30.00. The samosas were decent, but the seasoning was a little on the overpowering side. The pakoras were cold and not very good at all, and the raita pretty much tasted like bland yogurt water. YUCK. Another peeve was that I ordered the chicken tikka masala - which was $14 on it's own. Generally, anytime I order this, a side of rice is included. This was just a small plastic bowl of mostly sauce with maybe a cup of chicken chunks in it. Seriously? What am I supposed to do, drink the sauce? I wouldn't have ordered the side of yogurt water (which there was alot of) had I known I'd have no rice to put it on. I'll never go here again - another girlfriend of mine and I dined at an Indian joint on Friday night last week, got twice as much food, and only paid $45 for the both of us.

Can't figure out previous comment about grit in sauce; they do have a finishing sauce on the ribs which were both outstanding and very tender.  In addition both the sausage and brisket were excellent with just the right amount smoke flavor. 

For sides we had the baked beans, green beans and cornbread. Baked beans were some of the best we've had, and cornbread was excellent. Green beans were a bit crunchy for our taste but had great flavor. 

Overall, a great experience and it's nice to have a good BBQ offering in the Horsham area. We will be back soon.",2013-12-09 21:08:32,0.96882993,-0.8125667,0.19433303

On my last visit here, my friend ordered a chicken pesto panini and the chicken was a little under cooked. One of the workers/managers there offered to make her a new one. After doing so, he personally brings it to our table and then takes out his wallet and leaves cash on the table and insisted that the panini would be on him. After accepting the cash, another worker comes over with a plate of sushi (Bali Paradise). He told us that that was on the house. We refused to take it and they insisted.

Carts trundle past with speed and determination. Your tea, then water, then chili sauce is set down minutes apart, without ceremony or question. Chopsticks fly, noise assaults your ears, and you become mildly disconcerted because you have no idea what's going on, who you're talking to, and what's in that basket you just ordered.

Dynasty is located on the second floor of Chinatown's Pacific Rim Mall and there are enough tables inside to feed the whole population of Bandar Seri Begawan. If you visit the restaurant at peak times (weekends, 10am-noon), the dim sum service is out in full force. Carts will fly by your table. Cross your fingers that the siu mai hasn't run out before it reaches your corner of the room.

The service, while abrupt, is efficient. Ask for what you need and you'll almost always get it. Like the chili sauce? They might just bring you a half-bowl, if you ask nicely enough.

The dim sum isn't bad. It can be quite oily, which is the main downfall. The siu mai is tasty, but glistens in the fluorescent lighting. The deep fried shrimp dumplings are a consistently good staple of the dim sum experience; they're served with mayo, but don't let that deter you noobs out there. They're extremely tasty.

The har gow, my co-favourite item along with the siu mai, are well-made and petite - little balls of shrimp covered in an almost-transparent, papery dough. Dynasty's can be a bit sticky, but they're still very good.

I'm not a fan of the spare ribs and chicken feet, but the rest of the table attested to their tastiness. My English father and Italian boyfriend devoured them, while myself and my Chinese mother chose to play it safe.

The sticky rice is alright, although I've had much better. It's fine if you lather it in a ton of chili sauce, but is otherwise quite tasteless.

The best part about the meal, in this case, was the fact that it cost less than $60 for five people, which is a huge bargain for decent dim sum. It might not be the best and might be a little too oily to consume on a regular basis, but it's cheap and cheerful. And sometimes it's nice to have brunch amidst a rowdy, discombobulated mess of people, just to spice things up a little bit.",2014-01-17 20:49:38,0.2612265,-0.75327396,-0.13096891

No bride should leave a bridal store crying and in distress because the store sales people are so unhelpful!!

I want to love it. The meat I would give 5 stars. The sauce I would give 4.5 stars. But, I think the sides are just lacking. There seems to be a problem with even knife cuts and inconsistent seasoning as well. 
This time, my mom had a giant uneven slice of tomato on her burger and the kitchen forgot to put the cheese on it. I love the corn casserole, but it can sometimes be dry, and this time it was lacking salt. The other sides I've experienced are the collard greens which were good, but I just don't think I like collard greens. The baked beans were 5 star worthy. The sweet potato fries were cold and needed a lot more salt. They also were unevenly cut so some were more like chips and others were like fries. The creamed spinach was a little rich for me. I prefer my spinach a little less mushy and weighed down by heavy sauce. I've also tried the deviled eggs which were good. They're super tangy and heavy on the mustard though, so if you don't like mustard, you won't like them.
Overall, I like this place. The atmosphere and decoration is great. The smell is divine! I love the meats and the sauces! I just think they could do a little better on the sides. How hard is it to salt the food and cut it nicely??",2016-01-30 20:21:52,0.3381079,-1.0170614,0.76561826

On this trip our food was decent, but the establishment continues to go downhill in my book.

We had a gift card for over a year and needed a quick bite to eat so we headed on over to Applebee's. I am continually unimpressed with their mixed drinks so I stuck with water this time. We did order the new pretzel sticks and while they were good they didn't taste like pretzels. They were fried with a cheese dipping sauce. Not exactly what I was imagining when I ordered them.

My husband and I each ordered a burger. I wish they had more burgers on the menu because they are actually pretty good. I don't like that you can only order them pink or no pink though... umm what does that even mean? I'm scared to order no pink because I don't want it burned to a crisp. The fries would be decent, but holy salt. They were so salty. Our meals did take a while to come out so I'm glad we ordered that pretzel appetizer.

Our service was strange, we had one server when we arrived and then another one randomly showed up at our table to take our order with no explanation. Then our other server came back after food was delivered to check on us and refill our drinks.

I extremely dislike the new monitors they have placed on the table. You are able to order and pay on them, also play games and other things. Are they going to get rid of servers next? 

The best part of our visit though was the show, half way through our dinner someone at a table nearby threw a drink on their dining partner... I'm not even joking folks apparently this doesn't just happen in the movies. Stay classy Applebee's.

+ Cozy, sophisticated pub-like atmosphere
+ Live jazz music on weekends 
+ Mmm fireplace 

[CONS]
- Way overpriced, even for a hotel bar

I really do love the ambience at F&H - it's the perfect mix of cozy, dimly-lit, plushly furnished, and old-timey pub atmosphere that works well for a casual but sophisticated couple of post-dinner drinks. The last time I was here on a Friday night there was a live duo on upright bass and piano plunking down some Sinatra tunes. The atmosphere really is perfect - I only wish the drinks and service followed suit. 

Being a hotel bar, I sure get that prices will be steep. But not THIS steep, and certainly not this high considering none of the crafted cocktails ($12-13) we tried were particularly wonderful, let alone mindblowing. I'll give them credit for conjuring up cocktails inspired by various literary classics (e.g. ""The Last Word"", inspired by Bram Stoker's 'Dracula'). ""The Last Word"" is made with Beefeater gin, maraschino liqueur, lime & chartreuse. The drink was decent but the flavors just didn't meld right and felt like some element was missing. I felt similarly about ""The Moonstone"", which I was really excited for as it featured Pisco, one of my favorite liqueurs, but this also failed to deliver. I was especially disappointed when I saw our bartender shake out a butt ton of bitters to top the drink. Bitters are meant to be ""dashed"" with just a sprinkling...your drink shouldn't end up with a whole splatter of it. 

The last straw was being charged $20 (TWENTY) for a pour of Balvenie 12 year. New York prices in St. Louis... NOT OKAY, hotel bar or not. $20 for a small pour even in NY would be a bit steep. 

I was pretty dismayed with the quality of our cocktails, and even more disgruntled at some pretty unprofessional behaviors from the staff behind the bar. If I am sitting at the bar and can hear and see the bartenders jostling with each other, exchanging some ""you know you're not supposed to ____"" followed by ""shut up"" and ""no, you shut up""... something is not quite right.

I'd be willing to give F&H another chance, maybe to try the food, get some of those yardstick beers and try a few more cocktails, esp. because I like the environment so much. But we probably would avoid getting any whiskeys or scotches given the exorbitant prices.",2014-02-07 16:04:04,-0.34884936,1.1513689,-0.7496102

My friend kept on raving about Chik fil A and now I understand why. It's just so fresh, delicious, and guilt free. 

One day I passed by and saw a loooong drive through line and decided to jump on the band wagon. 

I was surprised at how fast they were handling business. Pretty impressive being that they just opened. On top of that, every worker I've encountered has been nothing but nice and well informed. 

My favorite sandwich is the #2  spicy deluxe sandwich with Chick fil A sauce. It's so spicy, but in a good way. Eating the juicy spicy chicken patty along with the buns, cheese, tomato, lettuce and sauce is just the best. Everything is incredibly well balanced. 
I mistakenly ordered the regular spicy chicken sandwich without cheese, lettuce and tomato one day and it wasn't nearly as good. 

I was surprised at how fresh the chicken was. I could see the moisture after taking a bite out of it, just as when I cook chicken at home fresh from the market.

Chick fil A must have the healthiest, tastiest and smartest kid's meals on the planet. The nuggets are fresh and delicious just like their sandwiches. For sides they have great options- applesauce or a fresh fruit cup. Their fruit cup was legit. It had mandarin oranges, blueberries, strawberries and apples and everything was so fresh. I also love their drink options-milk or organic juice. To top things off, they include a fun educational toy such as I spy booklets or pop out assemble yourself animals. Doesn't get any better than that. Finally a fast food place this mom approves of. 

Did I mention that they have the best milk shakes ever? I never order milk shakes but they turned me around all right. Seems like they use real ice cream and fresh milk. Their Oreo and vanilla milk shakes are so delicious and refreshing. They use fresh crunchy cookies and  actual vanilla flavor. The thickness and cool mouth feel is just right too. They top them off with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry. 

Try all of their sauces!!!! Sooooooo good. The combinations are endless. I like the Chick fil A sauce the most but also like combining the ranch with the zesty buffalo.

I've been here more times than I can count because I'm truly addicted. I talked to many workers at every location I go to and all of them swear by Chick fil A, eating here while they're working and even when they're off the clock.

I found Tace via Google and decided to check it out even though it apparently hadn't been open very long. It was a Wednesday night so we decided not to call ahead to make reservations and it turned out to be a good call. The restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived so we were seated right away.

The service was prompt, friendly and professional. I don't recall our waiter's name was he was really nice. He and the hostess took the time to tell us about the restaurant's history and the mission behind it all. Turns out Tace is a non-profit organization. All of the profits go towards a youth organization that is affiliated with Tace's owners. 

I ordered the New Orleans collection which consisted of Jambalaya, Crawfish Étouffée, Fried Catfish, Red Beans Blackened Red Fish & Gumbo. I love cajun food. Being from a food capital, Chicago, I've had the privilege of being able to enjoy authentic cajun food like one would find down south. I have to say that the food I had at Tace tasted unlike any cajun food I've ever had in my life.

The jambalaya and gumbo looked and taste exactly the same. I actually thought i'd received two of the same item and had the waiter check with the chef to make sure I'd received all the right dishes. I was informed that it was indeed gumbo and jambalaya. Turns out it didn't really matter because I didn't really care for dishes anyway. 

The catfish was good as were the red beans with rice. I can't really say I was especially impressed with the red fish though. I'm not a fan of crawfish etouffee so I didn't eat it. A friend of mine did and she said she thought it was okay.

The ambiance was nice so that added to the experience. The restaurant is nicely decorated with artwork from local artists. All of the pieces can be purchased as well. There were also salsa lessons being taught by a staff member while we dined. Dancing isn't my thing but it was fun to watch the others try their hand at it.

I was looking for a place that genuinely cared about their patients (MY PET) and I am so glad I choose P.A.W.S because they really do! And don't mistake me for a wealthy holistic person who can spend absurd amounts of $ just to have some animal magnetist communicate with their alive (or deceased--yes they actually have a flyer for that in their office) pet's inner spirit! I'm a 26 year old female who along with her 28 year old husband (still in college) spent 95% of my ENTIRE meager savings just to take care of my cat the way he deserves! (and every animals deserves quite frankly!) I truly believe every penny was well spent here and they certainly did not make me feel just like a number! The moment I called to schedule the appointment to figure out what was wrong with my Bubba's (my cat's) leg I felt a slight twinge of relief already (and believe me I am very anxious with very high standards so it's not always easy to communicate with me when I'm worried about something). They initially scheduled me for three days later but then I called them the next day even more concerned cause he had suddenly stopped wanting to walk all together! I expected them to instruct me to put him in a kennel until his scheduled appt  since I have dealt with ""busy"" vets in the past but I was pleasantly surprised when Dr. Aronson agreed to allow me to come in the next day instead since he appeared worried too. From the moment I walked in (the place is so well kept and tranquil) I continued to feel more and more at ease! They were friendly and prompt and understood that he was already under a lot of stress so they took me in fairly quickly. Jason was my Vet tech and he was the nicest most understanding person I have ever met! (anyone who can calmly deal with me in stress deserves a medal!) He briefed me a little but while he took Bubba's vitals before Dr Aronson came in. One of the first things I did was thank him for making a sooner appt and he said that he was concerned too when I called and told them Bubba was no longer walking. He and Jason were so kind and took the time to make me understand everything that they would do to try to figure out whats wrong. They gave me an itemized bill BEFORE doing any of the diagnostics so it was fair to me and allowed me to call my husband to discuss it! I was not so much concerned with the price (as my husband was) as figuring out what was wrong with my baby so we went ahead with most of the recommended diagnostics (mainly X Rays). They took Bubba back immediately to do the xrays  (I even went as far as almost instructing Jason how to hold him but instead of taking offense to this, since he obviously knew how to do his job, he told me he understood what I was going through and he would probably be the same way!) so I knew he was in good hands! During the time Bubba was in the back getting the xrays I didn't just have to sit there scared in the waiting room for long(which is lovely by the way--I had fresh tea from their Keurig and watched Tv and chatted with other friendly and satisfied pet owners) Jason took time out of his day to offer me a tour of the facility ( I got to see a dog on an underwater treadmill!-which made me feel a little better being distracted by something so fun).When the told me that he had a broken Femoral head they showed me te digital x rays and clearly explained to me my options. (They also gave me a cd of the xrays to take home). Dr Aronson recommended a surgeon at another office since he was unable to do the surgery himself. I'm writing this review after my experience with that other surgeon (whom I also loved!) since I wanted to see what kind of vets they refer to their customers and thus get the entire idea of how they operate. In all I will be a P.A.W.S customer for life and would recommend it to anyone who loves their pets as if they are their own children like I do!

Parking was terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised that, for a Saturday evening at a place Yelp reviews had told me would be packed, they were able to seat us right away. The servers took our orders pretty quickly, and our appetizers came out soon after. 

I ordered the agedash tofu and tempura udon, the latter of which came with a small salad and small bowl of miso soup. My agedash tofu, salad, and miso came out simultaneously. The salad had a dressing I'd never seen before on it, and I was skeptical, but it was ok. Not the best, but tasty. The miso was good, with plenty of tofu. 

The agedash tofu was not my favorite. It came in a bowl, swimming in a sweet sauce, which made what would have been a crisp outside soggy. The tofu itself was not the smooth consistency I'm used to with agedash tofu, and was actually somewhat chunky.

My udon, on the other hand, was wonderful. The broth was delicious, and the noodles had the best texture. The tempura were varied, not just shrimp, which made me happy.

I had been in numerous times before I found the car that was right for me. When I found my Fusion I wasn't sure we were going to get the numbers to work but the salesman I worked with, Jason, is also the lead loan guy and was able to help me pick out a car that would work right from get go which saved me the hassle of picking one I wasn't going to be able to afford. There also was no hassle of trying to haggle the price down. They automatically price the cars at the lowest they can, typically at or below the KBB value. I actually left the lot with equity in my new car which is incredible. The car I bought was, and still is, in great shape. There have been no issues and I feel that I bought a great car.

She would give me a brazilian wax about every 3 weeks. Wendy is absolutely amazing at everything that she does but recently has focused her talents more on skin care, primarily facials and things such as brow/lash tinting. She recommended that I try her fellow esthetician Alyssa and now I am hooked. Not only do we have the same name, which is pretty awesome but she is youthful, full of energy, super friendly and really knows what she is doing. Where before it has taken almost 25 minutes to do a Brazilian on me, it only takes Alyssa 10 minutes. That being said, I am Italian, pretty hairy and my hair grows out in several different directions near my bikini line, making it extremely hard to pull hair out without hurting me. Now, I have been to several other waxers before who claim to do ""speed waxing"" which ended being the worst nightmare you could imagine, leaving me bruised and uncomfortable for several days. She is the first waxer that I have had that pays attention to your hair growth patterns and pulls the strip accordingly, not just all the same way. Alyssa also specializes in waxing when their is only little growth. I referred my terrified friend who had not been waxed in years to try her out a month ago. She only had a week of growth since shaving and was doubtful that Alyssa could remove any hair, being that it was so short. She did just that and my friend was really impressed. The salon and spa atmosphere is tasteful, spacious and well decorated.  I will always see Wendy for facials and skin care treatments because of how awesome she is, but as far as Alyssa...

I never know what to get - since I do not actually like drinking alcohol, so I always ask the server to recommend something I could sip without wanting my fiance to finish it for me. Many have tried to find a drink like this for me, and they all failed. Well, all except sweet Erica.  Thank you Erica! 

We both got the NY Strip Steak, Amazing! It was so perfectly cooked and melted in our mouths. Will be sure to come again whenever in Philadelphia. Also got the bacon and onion mac and cheese - very rich in flavor but also amazing. The grilled asparagus was delicious - drizzled with balsamic. MMMM.. And the carrots were to die for. Whatever wasn't finished had to come home with us so i could eat it again!

DESSERT: Dan got the Creme de burle and even i liked it - very good. I got the blueberry and peach crisp..... It was so good, i almost wish I didn't eat so much so i could have finished it. It was so flavorful and perfect.

Because it was our anniversary they took a photo of us at the table and put it in a little frame for us and the dessert was on the house. Really and truly a wonderful experience and I would for sure recommend to anyone and everyone.

1)  Check pretentiousness and indecisiveness at the door.

3)  If you go close to closing time or try to rush him, you will be asked to leave
4)  Sushi for everyone, that is why his prices are so reasonable.  
5)  Everyone at one time?  Everyone will be asked to leave.  If you try to bring a huge group you will be asked to leave
6)  Get ready for a enlightening experience....

That promise was back in July, 2012. I corresponded via Facebook with the homesite, and I was asked to email the race director. After 3 emails there was a response in September. The RD indicated that a shirt would be mailed to me within 3 weeks. He also apologized and offered to comp my race registration for 2013, and that it would be in the middle of March.

Okay, so a Starbucks is a Starbucks and if you know me I love Starbucks.  I mean I am from Seattle after all ;-)

What I love about this Starbucks -

LOCATION!  I that it's on the corner of Jasper and 109 street and great for people watching and has wall to wall glass windows with three seating areas.  The staff are always friendly and drinks divine.

What I don't love as much about this location -

LOCATION!  Argh, sometimes there is no parking in the guard patrolled lot so you have to wait and wait and wait.  And don't go for a walk across the street or they will ticket you - Yikes!

Also, this is an uber busy location so they do run out of things.  So if you come here with your heart set on a blueberry scone, you might need to have a plan B.

And don't forget to use  registered starbucks card or download the starbucks app on your smart phone to collect stars for every purchase to earn free drinks and treats!

But through research, I heard that Ted Drewes was another must try in St. Louis and at the recommendation from my Forest Park friends, I headed there.

It was packed! And the people didn't stop coming. I had to park like two streets over, on some curb illegally, walk through and alley to get here.  I worked my way through one of the lines, only to see twice as many people filling in behind me. It goes fast, don't worry!

I asked around to figure out what to get and it was determined a concrete (much like a blizzard or blast) would be the best experience. I got the Fox Treat (fudge, raspberry and macadamia nuts). There is no pictured evidence of this treat because I got stuck in a traffic on my way to my hotel and it didn't last long. However, it was delicious. Ted Drewe's serves frozen custard and to me it was extra sweet.  Too sweet. Next time I'll probably stick with something more simple so I can get the true taste of the custard.  

Oh, one other note.  The portions are HUGE. I think I ordered a small or medium or something. Whatever size I got I was shocked and asked if they got my order wrong. Nope!

Joey B's has the biggest onion rings I've ever seen. After noticing a plate full going to another table, we ordered our own as an appetizer. They were quite tasty but incredibly difficult to eat, which I guess is the trade off for being huge. Everything else comes in huge portions, as well from the pasta to mashed potatoes.

Do you like to be in an ""it"" place? Are you OK with crowds and long waits?  If so, then you'll have a good experience braving VW at a prime time (weekend night, lunchtime). If not, there are plenty of times the bar is almost empty and you can enjoy a relaxing, delicious meal and chat with the bartenders - but you'll need to plan to go at an off-peak time. Some of my best VW experiences have been at 2:30 in the afternoon, stopping in for a late lunch and mid-afternoon drink. 

I've found the bartenders to be professional, knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating in the extreme. They're always happy to recommend a drink - or even craft one specially for me - based on nothing but the most vague suggestions or knowing what I'm having to eat. I am not a whiskey drinker, but even I can tell that the selection is extensive and the bartenders know their stuff. Whether you are a novice looking to explore or a seasoned whiskey drinker looking for a treat, I'm sure you'll find it here. 

The food is very good, although somewhat expensive. My favorite is the pork sammie, which comes with the most incredible fried pickle chips. Although they are only on the menu as an accompaniment for the sandwich, they *will* serve them to you alone if you ask! Which I highly recommend. The first time I ordered the sandwich I was a little disappointed - the meat was overly fatty, and the sauce was overwhelming the bun - but it's improved every time I've eaten it since. The burgers, as the other reviewers attest, are phenomenal. 

You should definitely leave some room to try something from the ""pickles"" menu. My favorite are the heirloom tomatoes - they have a wonderful texture and are bursting with flavor. The artichoke hearts were also delicious. All of the pickles are served with very good ricotta spread, tapenade, and bread.

Not only was the food amazing, but the service from everyone that works in this place was well above par. I had not even considered going here until our food tour guide said that someone had asked her if she had to choose between Mr. B's and the Commander's Palace, which one would she choose. She said that Mr. B.'s had some her of favorite dishes in all of NOLA, so hands down it had to be here. This is what made me CHANGE my dinner plans...and man was I happy that I did.
 
Since we decided to come here last minute, there were no reservations available. When we called, they told us that they do accept walk-ins, but there may be await. We arrived around 5 pm (hey I'm from the East Coast, it was dinner time for me), and they told us that they didn't actually open until 5:30 PM for dinner service. Since we were hungry, we just took a seat and figured that we'd wait until they were open. I swear at least 20 people came in after us, and the hostess had to perform the same song and dance about how the restaurant wasn't open for dinner service yet, but that they would be happy to accept walk-ins. She kept a smile the whole time and it sounded like it was the first time that she had to say that spiel that night. The reason that I'm commenting on this is because it is so easy to start getting irritated to have to say the same thing over and over, yet this woman greeted each guest as if they were the first group of people to walk in the doors that night.
 
We were actually seated a few minutes before 5:30, which I was surprised, but very pleased with. Our server came over and was very pleasant. The drinks that we ordered were perfect. My mom had a craving for red meat, so she got the Truffle Butter Filet Mignon. She said that it was cooked exactly how she ordered it, and was absolute perfection. We shared the Jumbo Sea Scallops as an appetizer. They were cooked beautifully. I had the brandy & apple cider braised rabbit, and could not believe how juicy it was. Rabbit is one of those proteins that can easily dry out, so I was very impressed. We ordered the Profiteroles & chocolate sauce to go (we had a short walk back to our hotel so we knew that the ice cream would not melt.)

The wrap comes with your choice of fries or hummus and salad (we both opted for the latter because we had fries all day.) Since we ordered hummus, it came with an extra piece of pita bread.

You can substitute tofu for eggs in most dishes; I choose their Surrey's Egg Plate (Surrey's Sub-the-Egg Plate?). It's going to become a great vegetarian-vegan compromise spot for us, I'm sure.

It was almost fully occupied on a Monday morning but my food came out quickly. The plate was really brown in the best carb-tastic way...home fries (really nicely spiced!), rye toast, and a few thick slices of solid tofu. Solid in all ways- texturally (maybe they freeze it? It's definitely pressed), flavor (no hint of beans like tofu can have when it's thrown straight into the pan from the water-filled package), and amount (I felt a bit skimped at first but it was quite filling). I was glad I got a carrot-grapefruit-cucumber juice to go along with it for some color and nutrients :] it was a very fair deal for a large juice.

Service was friendly and prompt. I was sad to see that they served their breakfast with cheap Smuckers jelly; I really hoped they would have some sort of better option.

Then another person came to serve us.  She asked if we were ready to order.  I sensed an attitude from her right away.  Nonetheless, I place my order, which was for Chinese tea, as that's all I was planning to have.

The other women with me were still looking at the menus, but went ahead and placed their drink orders.  The server then appeared agitated.  As she was walking away to get our drinks, I asked if there was a problem (remember, I'm not feeling well, so I'm not putting a lot of energy or neck movements into my question).  She said, ""I asked if y'all were ready!""  You see, she wanted to take our *entree* orders, not our drink orders.  That's what she meant by ""ready.""  When we only gave her our drink orders, it frustrated her and she let us know with her poor attitude.

As of last night I will not be returning due to he unprofessional staff and rude confrontations that I had to go through with them. 

We arrived a little after 10pm, waited for someone to sit us, we were sat in the bar area for a 4 top table by who I assumed was the hostess. Our server came, took our drink order and when someone wanted to order a draft we all had to pull out our ID's, which is fine. Whatever. The server informed us, as someone was under 21 at our table, that we could not drink out our table with them being underaged, so we decided to order our meals and us 21+ would go drink at the bar and come back. We get our meals, start to eat, and me and another guest from our table go to the bar to drink. 

We finished what we were drinking at the bar and paid our tab, went back over to our table to continue to eat and our server came to our table and confronted us, it was around 11:00pm, he continued to explain about the law about drinking at a table with someone underage, blatantly ignoring our friend, and how it was just the law [which we understood, and which is why we drank at THE BAR, away from him] and our server explained to us how ""It was starting to get busy and that because we had someone underaged we could finish our meal"" basically telling us that he wanted the table. 

I was very irritated by the server, this was rude, we hadn't been there for an hour, our meals were cold when we received them, and he wanted to get rid of us?! Seriously? NO ONE had walked into the door after this confrontation, and I KNOW because I watched the time on my phone because i hadn't seen many people come in at ALL it was a Wednesday NIGHT! 

Again, 2 from our table went up to the bar to drink, I stayed with our underaged friend. We sorted out our money for the check. The server CONTINUOUSLY passed our table after our money was ready, avoiding us, un-attentive to anything. He comes back apologizing to me and AGAIN paying no attention showing sympathy to our friend. He is apologizing for the law, I don't care. I know the law. I am upset he wanted us to leave, we WERE SAT IN THE BAR AREA BY STAFF i told him, and that's not my fault. I became very upset. 

After this I decide let's give this server the table so he can get over it, me and the friend under 21 sit furthest away from the bar and look for songs to sing for karaoke. At this point I am now being bothered by the Manager. Explaining to me that the kitchen closes in 4 minutes and that since we've eaten he can no longer JUSTIFY our friend being there. I'm Sorry, didn't know this was Gullifty's BAR. Our friend waited outside, not being able to even participate in the karaoke because of the continuous disruptions from staff and the rudeness that came with them. 

Train your staff and put some signs up about the 21+ after midnight for karaoke. I will NEVER be going back. I'd rather set fire to my money.",2013-01-04 02:36:50,-1.2621874,-0.98803955,-1.1282015

( our friends are picky).  Ok, so this location is downtown and that makes for a different cast of characters than you get in Lenox.  However, the table sitting behind us was loud and very vulgar in their conversation.  One dude was particularly shit-faced.  I don't shock or offend easily and he was grossing me out.  Our friends have finer sensibilities than we and they were quite bothered.  To our server's credit she did apologize and explained that the manager was on it and the table should be leaving soon.  She did offer us the choice to move; our friends declined.  So that happened.  The food was good.  Tater tot fondue was delicious of course...wish it was somehow a healthy choice because YUM. I had a turkey burger with pineapple and avocado and a side salad.  It was all good but not ""OMG"" good.  A little less good than the Lenox location.  They screwed up my hub's order.  The server made a ""voila"" moment out of presenting him with his Jack Daniels burger...except he didn't order the JD burger, he ordered the Fenway.  she whisked it back to the kitchen and got him the correct order tout suite.  Everyone ate their food without complaint which is pretty amazing for this crew.  Overall a 3 star experience.",2015-04-04 13:52:06,-0.39708883,-0.13814567,-0.8952693

The food here is just like waking up from a long awaited nap after the heat of battle.

If they do have specialty, it's probably their sopes and huaraches (kinda like tacos but the meat's piled high on a thick, fried corn tortilla).  They do dribble mayo pretty liberally on much of their food so I try to remember to ask them to leave it off.  The sopes also come in 3's, but they're very filling, I'd go with two next time.

The carnitas was better than lengua or carne asada, cabeza and maciza aren't available here.

The fish tostadas made with ceviche are really good, although one of my friend's was way too limey, more so than his other two (he ordered three).

It's also connected to a market, has a few vegetables, some good snacks, I picked up a handful of jalapenos to complement my trader joes salsa at home, and the owner waved it off, said, ""next time.""  Cool.

So why not 5 stars?  
last time i went, bit on something hard, figured a bone got into the carnitas, turned out to be a staple.  a dirty, twisted staple.  whatever, it's only happened once, i can forgive it, it won't keep me from going back.
what really knocked off the star was that they don't have any beer, and if i can't have a negra modelo, or at the very least, sol, it's just not a complete experience for me.

This is probably a new location because the lounge area seemed very new.  With 4 flat screen TVs hanging off the walls, maybe this wouldn't be too bad of experience.  OH wait!

My friend suggested we go for the 7-8-9 menu.  So I ask what the heck is that?  Well it's lunch deals for $7,$8 and $9.  Not really impressed with what I saw, I settled on the St. Louis Ribs. 

As we waited for our food, my friend asked the bartender to change the channel to watch one of the afternoon hockey games since it was American Thanksgiving.  Well to our dismay, their satellite package didn't have more than Sportsnet West.  That was a sign of things to come.

Our food came out pretty quickly.  As expected, I received the frozen ribs, previously cooked ribs that were sitting on the grill then reheated.  They were dry with very little meat.  The mashed potatoes weren't too bad but the coleslaw was ""wet"".  My coworker ordered some beef sandwich and anything served on a kaiser makes it horrible.

It's pretty close quarters with nowhere to wait for your table if you're early for your reservation like we are, but the location is great, and we were able to grab a quick drink at Mixto across the street (where customer service is sometimes seriously lacking).  What's good about being in such a small and intimate space is that you get a good look at what everyone's ordering, and everything looked delicious.  You are, however, knocking elbows with adjacent tables and can't exactly have any quiet conversation.  Farm & Fisherman is not the place to go for a quick bite.  I don't know if they're going for the ""slow food"" thing, but there was a long time between courses (filled with rolls and amazing house-made butter).  The food was really outstanding though and one of the best meals I've had in a while.  The farro soup was impossibly smooth with juicy chicken and a bright bite of microgreens - I asked if there was any cream in it because of the consistency, but nope that's just pure vegetable goodness.  We also had the prosciutto wrapped egg and pigs ear salad with pine nuts and lardoons (fabulously crispy and beautifully dressed).  For my entrée I had chicken...it was amazing, but I can't remember much else about it because I lost myself in the best hen of the woods mushrooms I've ever tasted in my entire life.  Actually, probably best any mushroom prepared any way I've ever had in my entire life.  Servers were moderately attentive and very knowledgeable.  We'll definitely be back.

For whatever reason, I like to grow my hair out as big and as untidy as possible.  My thick locks are wavy and what many would classify as ""unkempt"" when allowed to grow freely.  Not to say that my hair is dirty because I do wash it every day, but I just like the way my hair looks and feels when it is a booming mop.

There are other factors in life that when coupled with my lion's mane develop issues that need to be dealt with.  For one- I work at a financial institution, and as much as I would love to say that the world has developed into an open-minded, physical-appearances-don't-matter type of place (where everyone holds hands, endlessly sings lovable Cat Stevens songs, and skips along in unison), the reality is you all are a bunch of judgmental 'yotches who for some reason DO care about how my hair looks and think that it somehow makes me incapable of doing my job...

Well, maybe not *you*...  But definitely you there!

This ""feature"" of society (the part about judging a book by its cover) is multiplied 10-fold by the simple fact that I come from the Midwest.  OK- Chicago is cool and contemporary and all, but it still is the Midwest folks!

Or maybe I am the one that is delusional?  Maybe I just look rank with my wildin' out, big ass hair?  After all, it is my beautiful and fashionable wife who delicately reminds me a few times a year that my hair is, after all, something that needs care and styling, or at least a good hacking to.  Probably more care than the fine ladies at Hair Cuttery are capable (or more likely WILLING) of giving.

Which brings me to Dapper.  A friend of mine was raving about the job that these ladies do.  I pride myself in being quite open-minded, but was surprised to hear that it was a ""full-blown"" barber shop run by some tattooed punk rock ladies, ala roller derby style.  Where they offer complimentary beer and pool games while you wait for a chair to open up.  This alone wasn't enough to shock me, but the fact that it came from this particular friend.  What I mean to say is that if there was anyone in the world that I would guess did not give a crap about where he got his hair cut, it would be him.  He has had the same hair cut for over 15 years- military style.

So why go here, a hip place, clearly catered to those that are looking to pay a lot for a good haircut in a unique setting?  He then tells me because a cut is only going to cost $15.

To start the trip off, my hair was beyond the point where my wife was going to tolerate it much further.  I was at the ""wing"" stage, where the hair around my ear begins to uncontrollably flip up and look as if I did it on purpose with a hot curling iron or something (childhood evidence: http://static1.px.yelp.com/photo/YaQT9rb_q7LgQRD5Lhg8AQ/l ).  

Winter in Chicago was coming!  I needed natural ear muffs!

As you can imagine- this ""excuse"" only goes so far.

So in I go, with wife in tow (I'm a poet and didn't even know it!).  We arrived only a short while before closing and I timidly asked if it was cool for me to still get a cut.  ""Of course!"" was the response, ""have a seat over there, help yourself to whatever is in the fridge and someone will be right with you!""

Hoping that they would turn me away for coming in too late, or without an appointment or whatever, I walked my shaggy self over to a couch and waited, stroking my long locks one last time before losing them (and about 5 pounds- my hair gets huge).

I was shortly called over by Jo, a fellow Illinoisan (is that what we are supposed to call ourselves?) by upbringing, who called me over and asked what I wanted.  ""I need a haircut, but don't really want one.""  After figuring out why I didn't want one (and agreeing with me, probably more out of kindness and empathy) she let me know I would be in good hands and that she would make things right.

Hair washed, and she goes into cutting.  Old-school style.  The way I remember getting it as a kid.  Nothing but scissors and straight razor.  No clippers (which I usually ask for a #3) with my cut.  And yet she got my noggin looking sharp, but still with some length and good shape.  Wings gone, or more like trimmed back, or tucked in or something.

I don't know how to describe the cut- but it looked really good!  Especially after the initial shock of losing my beloved, over-sized helmet, and realizing that I COULD in fact get my hair cut short and still have it look pretty good- and not have to spend a ton of money to do so!

And as for Jo- AWESOME.  She kept the conversation going and was into some really cool stuff!  I walked out with some weight off of my shoulders (figuratively and literally), and money left in my pocket.  Not to mention a very happy wife, who happened to start her night of drinking off the right way with a complimentary beer from that fridge.

Thanks Jo!  Wish you all were up here in Chicago...  I am sure for the same amount of dope service, I will be dropping $50.",2009-10-17 20:26:58,-2.2958007,-0.659639,1.2311932

- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.

- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?

- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.

- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.

- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.

EDIT:

- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.

- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice.",2014-01-17 21:10:17,0.57584304,-1.294578,0.17672768

Cons:  Not to much to say here. The only thing I can say is that the Village Pub & Beer Garden has limited food menu options but I do understand they are a pub and not a restaurant as such.",2011-05-28 15:56:24,0.71750516,-0.529389,-0.53022873

And after eating there I definitely see where he's coming from, so if Burger Republic wants to offset all these Atlanta restaurants popping up in Nashville, you are very welcome down here thanks.

I could not pick a burger, so when your vegetarian friend says you could get the Buy the Farm! then, well, you clearly gotta go with that. There was a fried egg, bacon, gouda, red pepper relish, and your usual tomato, lettuce, and onion. So really it was everything I would choose for a burger but already done for me. I'll say I didn't really notice the relish, but everything else about it was amazing. Best burger I've ever had? No. But then I can't speak for your city, so no comment there. It was really good overall though. I just think over time I have come to appreciate simpler stuff for toppings maybe and a lot of the ones here seem kinda crazy.

For a side I had the mac and cheese and it was so good. I was kind of sad when I finished it. Definitely worth the upcharge.

My friend also got a Nutella milkshake and had me try it and I'm gonna be honest. This one is better than Flip's and I have had a lot of Nutella milkshakes there. Perhaps that's the difference between a milkshake and being fancy with nitrous oxide hmmm.

The roll very crispy and fresh, the flavors very strong- jalepeno, cilantro, sauteed veggies, tofu, and some sort of yellow mayo that I always think is a dessert (mango pudding?) when I see it in the case.  Anyway the sandwich is delicious, and although prices are now $4 for a sandwich (up from $1.50) its still a steal for a quick lunch.  I also tried the rice and mung beans with coconut milk for dessert- delicious, an excellent way to add a little protein to a yummy dessert.

Check in was interesting....They had 3 people checking in about 80 new arrivals. Luckily for me, I was only 10 people deep and so my wait was pretty decent. Something like that wont ruin my impression of this place.

Gaylord Opryland is a beautiful resort. I spent most of my time in the atrium, listening to the waterfalls and looking at all the palm trees, architecture, koi in the river, etc...

I understand why many people bitch about the layout and how far it is going from one section to the other, however.....have you ever been to Vegas?? If so, this place is a cake walk. I'm pretty sure if this was small, and compact...it wouldn't be a convention center.

My room was just fine for what it was. It felt a little dated, but it had every amenity that I needed. The bathroom had a spacious shower, and enough counter space for me to lay out toiletries for my stay. 

House keeping did a great job of cleaning my room daily. Lots of hotels have a habit of picking up all your personal stuff and either puting it in piles, or moving it around enough that it leaves you with a really insecure feeling.  What I appreciated was that they simply straightened out my stuff and left it where it was.

They have many places to eat and drink here.  I didn't eat at any of the restaurants that were housed within Gaylord, so I can't speak to that. I would suggest taking a cab downtown and hitting up some good ol' Tennessee BBQ. Cab's from Gaylord to downtown are $25 and $1 per head after that. So make sure you plan for that one.

Service was great all around. Even when having breakfast and lunch in the convention area, I was impressed with the food they brought out. It was no culinary master piece, but it was a hell of a lot better than i've had in the past at Ceasar's Palace in Vegas.

This is a seriously cute little independent book store nestled in a quasi dead shopping center in the Old Orchard section of Webster.  I only found it because I love penny candy and unfortunately spend a little too much time at Ben Franklin's around the corner. 

However, I am so glad I stumbled in here. It's small and, therefore, does not have everything nor does it have 14 copies of every book in existence like say, Borders.  However, if you are looking for something and they don't have it, they are more than happy to order it for you and it will get to you in you in just a few days, even if it's a rare book.  Not bad.  

Also, the place is cozy.  I mean, really cozy and warm. There are comfy chairs and a nice bright atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and they actually have helpful suggestions because they are avid readers and book lovers.  They REALLY know what they are selling and I love that.  I have a little niece that doesn't like to sit still for books.  When i explained this to one of the ladies working, she pointed out a perfect book (It's called Dog Food for anyone who may have a similar situation) and my 16 month old niece LOVES it.  I am telling you, they actually know their stuff, it's wonderful.

Also, great coffee and treats.  It's a little bookstore like something out of Gilmore Girls.  I just loved it in there.  Also, unlike a lot of independent stores, the books cost the same as at any big chain.  Maybe not the same slasher sales, but if you are looking to pay fair prices (say 12.99 for a paperback) this place is great.

Big fan.  OH, and if you go on a Tuesday, that's when they get their deliveries, so chances are, if it's popular, your book will be there.  I am told they get deliveries a few times a week, but with Tuesday being the big book day (like how new DVDs are released on Tuesday) I have experienced this may just be the best day to buy books, period.",2009-08-06 19:12:20,-1.3843858,0.2868128,0.28865275

The prices are insane, I mean a 16oz. frappe for $6.78 tax included?!?!  The bar service is slow.  People act like tourists inside, milling around like it's their first time out of doors and there is no organization to the queue.
But the positive makes up for all of that.  The gelato is fantastic and the flavors are constantly rotated.  If you go this week, and then again next week, you will not see the same selection.  I have never had a ""bad"" gelato here.  The texture is correct, the flavors are creative and interesting, and it's not too rich.  Grab an affogato (drowned) which is gelato with a shot of espresso poured over it and revel in the decadence.  Frappes are great. 
 If you are depressed or lonely or unhappy, this place will remind you that, indeed, there is good in this world.

I've always struggled with vet visits with them because I feel like it is important to balance their pain and frustration of having to go to the vet with what is best with them.  The Cat Clinic is the first place I've been to (in 15 years of owning cats) where I felt like they are also concerned with that.  

Example - my girl has to go in every 6 months for a checkup due to kidney failure.  One visit, she had another off result and they wanted her back in 3 months to recheck that number.  So, I brought her back in 3 months.  The re-check showed that she was back to where she was supposed to be and the vet was so pleased at how well she was doing otherwise that she told me to just skip the next 6 month visit (then 3 months away) and she'd see her again in 9 months.  That kind of thing means a lot to me - it saves my cat stress and it saves my pocketbook.  Most other vets I've been to would have just told me to keep the appointment because that was additional money for them but not these guys.  Of course, that means when they tell me something does need to be done, I know that it really is for the best interest of my cat and I'm more than willing to do it.

I'm also impressed with how well they deal with my biter.  Both Dr Freesh and Dr Kinnunen take me seriously when I remind them that he gets too freaked out to control himself and they handle him firmly (but gently!) from the start.  They don't hold it against him either - they make sure that he gets a thorough exam in as calm of an environment as possible.  It reduces the stress of everybody, including the cat, when we don't have to deal with chasing him around the office while he attempts to bite everything within reach.  The new doctor didn't listen to me so well on that point but after the bite that she got, I'm sure she will in the future. 

Bottom line - I can trust them to do everything in the best interest of my cats.  For a nervous 'mother' like me, that is invaluable.  They are cat lovers and that is great too but they are true professionals first and that is why I'd recommend them.",2012-08-19 23:18:02,-2.1959267,-0.3538257,0.23902476

My boyfriend is a huge hot chicken fan.  So naturally, this weekend when we saw that The Hot Spot was going to be at the Wanderland Nash Food Truck Frenzy at Elmington Park, we headed on over.

For Nashville food trucks, the prices are average with most meals around the $7 range.  Where as most of the other food trucks had their bottled water and drinks for $1, The Hot Spot had theirs at $1.50.  All their drinks were $1.50 whether it was a 16.9 ounce bottled water or a 12 ounce can of pop.  Probably best to check other food trucks for drinks.

On to the food, I have a very weak palate for spicy.  So my boyfriend ordered the 2 piece ""Twisted Chicken"" with one with Sriracha on it and one without.  And we also ordered some hand cut fries.  It took a little bit for the ladies in the truck who were taking the orders/payments to get everything completed with our transaction, but by the time we got that taken care of, our food was done.

The seasoning on the chicken is totally bomb!  It is spicy by itself without their sriracha.  The inside of my lip tingled.  It was perfectly spicy for me.  And my boyfriend liked it as well.  He actually said he liked it better without the sriracha on it.  The chicken was fried perfectly.  The skin was crispy without being ""over breaded"" and was incredibly juicy, tender, and temperature hot...as well as spicy hot!  I kinda wished that my boyfriend and I had not split the 2 piece order!

Dinner on Sunday night started with the pate and crispy Brussels sprouts- both were outstanding. My husband had gumbo and the other three of us had the salad Luke with buttermilk dressing. This was the only less than part of the meal and it was simply 3 pieces of really rusty lettuce.
Two steaks ordered and totally enjoyed- one shrimp and grits with blue crab- and one crawfish etouffe.  Not much conversation and some fork passing was had- everything was incredible.

But. An $8 ""vegetable"" salad consisted of arugula and carrots (barely heated up and basically raw) with an über salty brown butter ""dressing"". And it was on a side salad plate. Not good.

We continued to the veal meatballs which were completely dried out and dense. They didn't even really taste like veal -- you expect a little gaminess with some sort of aggressive spice. We got nothing. The polenta on the plate and the sauce was pretty good though (and it's a lot of food, definitely shareable if the meatballs themselves were better).

Then, it was on to dessert. We love dessert. Especially panna cotta. And even more if it's chocolate. Which is what was advertised. What we got though? Some sort of watery, jello-y concoction ... I wish I would have taken video. It was so weird. Like it was made from a box with water instead of cream, or milk even. Tasteless and boring.

And damn, expensive to boot. I can't imagine a scenario where I would want to go back here -- unless I just wanted to sit down for a while with a glass of wine, cause it is a nice looking place with nice people working there and what appears to be a good, extensive wine list (we did not partake).

My first impression, was that I was really impressed with the interior. They've done a remarkable job transforming a movie rental store into a classy restaurant.  The exterior is pretty much unchanged from the Movie Gallery though. 

To start, we had the salsa trio, which was good, but I found the salsa to be a bit more runny than I like, and at $8, a bit overpriced. The green salsa was by far our favorite.

For dinner, I had the tamal corn cakes. The beef on top was delicious, but I felt that the corn cake underneath was too sweet - like a very sweet cornbread, when I was expecting more of a tamale filling.

My girlfriend had the short ribs, which were good, but not mind-blowing. At $24, it just didn't quite seem to live up to expectations.

What keeps me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, is that I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I would've liked. There are a million places around in that price point, so the competition is stiff. I wouldn't mind exploring the menu a bit more though, to see if I discover any favorites, but I could take it or leave it.

So the choices felt limited.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and have to admit that I was choking them down because I was hungry.  They tasted like they were double dipped in sugar.  Also, once another 10 or so people came in, it was very hard to hear each other because the noise level skyrocketed, which is surprising with so much fabric in the room.

Finally we found it and ordered the cheese curds for eight dollars and we spent another $.50 each on a dipping sauce. The people there were friendly enough and explained to us the difference between mozzarella sticks and what they were offering and seemed very confident that it would be better than anything we've had. So excitedly we went in for a taste - of the four of us one didn't care for them at all and would not eat a second one. The other three of us thought they were okay but nothing to write home about but none of us could finish them - too much cheese. I would have preferred that mine would've been breaded a little bit heavier and fried a little bit longer so they were crispier but what we kind of ended up with was a bit of a soggy mess. We were very surprised, due to all the raves, and sadly disappointed. I think with the amount of money you spend for them you're really hoping for a better experience. If they had cost less we would have had lowered expectations. The reviews and cost raised the bar. So, would I buy them again, or recommend someone else buy them? Well if you like mozzarella sticks these are a creamier version and would do the job but there is not enough of a difference in this item for me to buy them again.",2013-12-07 20:51:14,-0.07708421,-0.86495686,0.16053411

I think their signage has gotten better as I was reminded of it every time I even came close to Fishers this month. The fact that it occurs the weekend before Independence Day always throws me off so I'm bummed when I miss it. 

It's always hot this time of year, but that almost doesn't matter as there is a ton of shade! The Sun King beer garden also had covered seating and other tables with umbrellas for relief from the hot sun. 

I recommend parking at the park for $5. You can take a free shuttle to city hall for free parking, but you are limited to the hours it runs so parking at the park gives you a little more freedom to come and go as needed. It was organized very well and they made parking very orderly and spacious so that it was easy to get in and out. 

I haven't attended the parade or the fireworks they do every year, but they have quite the turnout for the parade as evidenced by all the chairs and blankets that are set up beforehand! People also bring their dog so it's a dog-friendly event as well. They seem to have a ton of stuff for the kids too. 

I love the arts/crafts vendor area. It's fun to discover new and exciting businesses in Indiana. This year we found some awesome Indiana patriotic shirts and some amazing BBQ sauce and seasoning!

This is a 3 story house with plush cushions to relax on and rugs on the wall, and groups sit around a table in different rooms in the house. It's all very intimate & relaxing. You can also bring your own bottle even though Marrakesh has a full (cheap) bar. 

It seems they try to seat people around the same time, and since this is a 7 course meal you need at least 2 hours. This also means that you can't come to the restaurant at 10 pm since they close around 11 pm. You should also make reservations because it gets crowded on the weekend. 

Out of the 7 courses we could only finish 4 of them--the amazing salad, the bastilla, the wonderful herb chicken that's prepared for 3 hours, and the baklava. Neither of us liked the beef kabobs since it was well done but I'll try the lamb next time.

As long as the water looks blue (and you think no one is watching), all you have to do is splash a little water on the surrounding patio...DONE! 
You don't have to clean the pool basket, the pump basket, the filter, you don't even have to brush the pool! No worries if the pump isnt working properly due to a dirty filter; just throw a couple chlorine tablets into the pool basket and adjust the timer so the pump runs longer. Nevermind that it drastically increases the power bill; residents are so stupid they dont know any better. Oh...and you never have to worry about securing the gate when you leave; it's not your problem if the residents dog gets out and runs into traffic.
1/03/2017 UPDATE: Once again, Bayside Pool Service shows up unannounced on an alternate day. I've asked nicely, pleaded, and further demanded that they at least send me a text msg to let me know- as I suffer from anxiety due to DV. Over 1 year has gone by and they continue to ignore my simple request. By showing up unexpectedly they not only cause a panic attack, they leave the gate open Every Single Time which allows the dog to get out and harrass the neighborhood and perhaps worse. They come and go as they please with not even a note on the door. In addition, the water in the pool pump has been running drastically low for months now. Upon my own investigation I found that there is a break in the seal causing air to enter the pump. This was brought to their attention weeks ago yet nothing has been done. They didn't even show up for a regular cleaning last Wednesday. Not that it matters since they Rarely even brush the pool anyway. They just piddle around with a net for a few minutes, then leave.

As far as overall value goes, this is extremely affordable for the buffet and the options provided to you. The buffet can vary in options but generally has popular dishes most expect at an Indian place along with several vegetable and dessert options. 

The customer service is very attentive and friendly and I often see that they have regulars that they are casual with and I think that's nice. 

I found out through a friend that they do serve lassi's (just ok tasting) and gulab jamun (included with buffet) but you have to request these which is a bit strange as they do not even offer a regular menu when ordering buffet. It kind of makes me wonder what else they offer via special request. 

Realistically I give this place 3.5 stars only because the food has been hit or miss when I come. Sometimes it's flavorful and excellent while other times there are several dishes lacking substance and flavor. I will continue to come here because the location is convenient and I like to have various options when eating ethnic food so I'm not restricted to a single dish I may not like.

The menu is very stripped down - most of what you might get is meat (sauce on the side, though the meat itself is very flavorful); rice and peas (beans); and a slice of fried plantain.  Simple food, totally delicious.  I am a big fan of the dark meat chicken to the point that I daydream about it sometimes.  For $7 or so you get a large amount of chicken, the sides, and a cup of mild or hot sauce.  Go for the hot - it's not spicy enough to burn your eyebrows off, just enough to let you know it's there.

The menu is now chef inspired, with the specials truly highlighting the talented kitchen. But quite honestly, both my husband and I have our favorites on the regular menu, so we rarely even make it to the special board. 

We all know the foundation of a great sandwich is delicious bread, and Molldelli has certainly figured that out... both the regular hoagie roll and the wheat roll are fantastic. My husband's favorite sandwich is the hot salami (but do be warned... it is super spicy), and I adore the chicken club. But lately we've both been fixated on the buffalo chicken salad. It's so good! You know when you order a salad and the ratio of lettuce to toppings is off? That's very much not the case with this salad - you have plenty of toppings from start to finish. The only change we make to it is having the chicken served hot (on the menu, it's cold). It's just a personal preference, but for us, it makes it just slightly better.

Then, there is a huge, open, bright room with lots of toys. This is where the librarians have story time. When we visited, story time was happening so we couldn't play with all of the toys -- it would have disrupted the scene. This is the one bad thing about this area: you can't have all of the toys in an area and not let the kids play with them! Oh well.

I got to know all of the baristas there because I spent nearly every day there, working on my grad thesis.  They're pretty awesome because they usually know what I'm going to have before I get to the front of the line.

Their coffee is outstanding and somewhat addictive, to the point that if I'm out of town I refuse to drink coffee.  It has a really rich flavor, and they brew it to perfection.  As someone noted earlier, their lattes can be on the lukewarm side, so if you like things piping hot, tell them to make it ""extra hot"" and they're more than happy to oblige.

Although people find their lack of menu intimidating, the baristas are more than happy to tell you what they have available.  Basically, it's anything coffee-related, but don't ask for flavors or crazy milk.  They don't have it.  They have bittersweet molten chocolate that they use to make hot cocoa and mochas-- yum!  They usually have a great selection of pastries and goodies-- try the tarts or a croissant; they are all really delicious.

One of the drawbacks of the place is that they don't have wifi or a ton of electrical outlets for computers.  That is a blessing in disguise for me, because I get very distracted by procrastinating on the web, so I purposely go there to work because I know I'll sit there and write rather than checking my email every few minutes.

We have stayed at the Windsor several times and didn't think it could get any better, wrong! Upon arrival we were greeted by name by the friendly and attentive front desk staff who made us feel at home. Angela in reservations, knowing our preferences, took excellent care of us. Now for the suites, all I can say is WOW. The newly renovated, huge updated-rooms were beautiful and most important clean. This was the first time we had a suite in the ""back"" of the hotel facing the Comcast Center on Arch Street. It was a pleasant view and ever so quiet. The new bed and pillows were comfortable adding to a restful night's sleep. It was especially helpful that there was an area outside the bathroom with a granite counter and stool with a mirror for applying makeup and blowing out my hair with the hair blower provided by the hotel. The newly renovated full kitchen was great, new appliances, wood laminate flooring and granite counter tops was not only atractive but very functional as we had coffee (provided by the hotel) and toast in the room every morning. I loved the decor, especially the bathroom.WIFI was fine for us. To us, there is no other place to stay in Center City but the WINDSOR. We can't wait for our next trip back to the Windsor in a few months. Kudos to the entire staff at this wonderful hotel and hopefully I didn't shoot myself in the foot by letting people in on the secret of this gem. 

Tips: There is a taxi stand when you walk out the door and take a left.  Higher floors have the best view and are the most quiet. WAWA is right around the corner (1 minute walk) and Walgreens is 1 block away (3 minute walk).",2013-03-28 18:53:47,-1.360711,0.05765755,-0.48528913

It's a build your own bowl. Buffet for dinner, one bowl or buffet for lunch. They also have soup, rice, and sesame bread offered. You'll be look at $17 for all you can eat with a soft drink, which isn't bad. 

You start by getting what you want, then you drop it off at the cooking station, then you get your sides, then you pay. This confused me the first time I went so y'know, just an FYI folks. 

The quality is generally fairly good. Sometimes the vegetables are left out a little too long, and sometimes the meat available is the shredded remains and not actual slices... but when drowned out in strong flavors as is common here it is less of an issue. For food that's cooked on the spot, it comes out pretty quick. I generally will get my bowl before I have finished up my soup, which is pretty good. You get to choose how you want your sauce done and they do recommend combinations of flavors, but I generally will do my own thing. Their soups are generally pretty solid, and they will provide as much soup, rice, and bread as you want. 

Mongolian BBQ isn't necessarily something that is in the forefront of American eating, but this is certainly worth trying if you're unsure or curious about it.

The menu, though, is anything but corny.  I was surprised to find a place in my own backyard that featured housemade beignets and chicory coffee.  Soon after sitting down, our friendly server brought us a sample plate of homemade biscuits topped with creamy, flavorful cream chipped beef.  My husband went on to order the full cream chipped beef platter for breakfast, which came served over fresh white toast and with crispy, oniony potato cakes.  I went with crepes, which were served paper thin and filled with perfectly tender-crisp asparagus, mushrooms and feta cheese.  My potatoes were more traditional diner hashbrown, but with tiny flecks of crispy bacon throughout and served with my choice of either redeye or sawmill gravy.  I chose both.

Throughout our breakfast, my coffee cup remained full and our server stopped by a number of times to see if there was anything we needed.      I was too full to indulge in the beignets she suggested at the end of our meal, but will definitely be back again to try the doughy fried puffs.  And maybe the brioche French toast.  Or the homemade waffles.  Or the eggs Benedict served on a bialy... Mmmmm... Like I said, I will DEFINITELY be back.",2010-01-24 02:00:09,-0.51841164,0.79076016,-1.1074079

I guess it was just as well.  I wasn't terribly impressed.

This past tuesday night my dinner group and I descended upon Burger Up.  We were seated quickly and they were able to accomodate our group of 8 people.  

We placed our drink order and received those rather quickly with food orders going in shortly after receiving our drinks.  

Here is where the wheels fell off the bus.

Our order starts coming out and they bring 3 plates.  So, our friends are sitting there for probably another 5 minutes or longer waiting for the rest of us to get our food before they would eat(even though we all told them to go ahead).  Finally - a few more plates come out.  In all - service took about 10 minutes from the first 3 plates to the time everyone had their food delivered.  Really?  I realize it was 8 plates - but you should be able to time the orders so that everything can be served at once.  I've worked in several restaurants in the past.  It takes some coordination but it can be done.  So, that made for an inconvenient dinner for us.

Then the actual food.  In the words of the old lady from the 80's Wendy's commercials....Where's the beef?  These were incredibly small patties of beef.  I wasn't expecting a burger the size of my head - but, it was smaller than a quarter pounder from McDonald's.  Maybe this was 1/8th of a pound or something?  I don't know - but it wasn't much.  I cut the burger in half and there was so much bread surrounding the beef - I probably could have put both halves on one side of the bun.  It was seriously THAT small (or the bun was that big).  I wish I was exaggerating.  It was shocking how small it was.  For the price I was expecting a little more beef.  I got the Ramsey burger - it was 11 bucks and came with pimento cheese on it.  And yet again, I was expecting a little more pimento cheese on the burger.  It was nothing more than a slight smear of it on the bun and you could hardly taste the pimento cheese at all.  Very bland.  The truffle fries I got were slightly cold - but, had a good flavor.

They brought out two bottles of stuff which I have no idea what they were.  I""m assuming one was a homemade ketchup and the other - I have no idea.  It was a white-ish sauce.  No explanation was given.  But the ketchup mixture was pretty good so, kudos for that.

All in all, though - I fail to see the value of this place.  The burger was small, food came out slowly and the pimento cheese on my burger was tasteless and the price we paid was a premium price. All in all - not that impressed.  

But - the whole experience wasn't terrible.  The atmosphere was nice.  The service was decent (aside for the food delivery aspect).  I'm not sure I'll go back however.  I can get better burgers, better service, closer to home for less money.  Yes, it was local beef and local ingredients and that is cool and all.  But, if I'm going to pay over 20 dollars after tax and tip for a burger - I expect a little more.  Nothing really wow'ed me about this place.

When I review places - I think was there anything about the place the impressed me?  Like, I can excuse bad service if the food is amazing.  You might have had a bad server that night.

I can excuse bad food if the service is amazing.  Maybe something happened in the kitchen and the regular cook wasn't there tonight.  

But nothing wow'ed me.  The food was average at best.  The service was ok.  But nothing memorable.  You can get better burgers at:  Five Guys, Burger Republic, Bricktop's, The Pharmacy and lots of other places.  But, if you happen to be around 12th South and want some food - it isn't a horrible choice.  I may even go back again if I happen to be in there area.  This is just not a place that I will be going to go out of my way to try again.",2013-06-02 16:57:33,0.2429183,-1.3728024,-1.28977

We first showed up at The Workshop Eatery (Now known to us, simply as ""Workshop"") at the beginning of March to celebrate the successful end to my ESL teaching practicum before the coming of our little one. To say that I was utterly impressed would be an understatement! 

The meal was the best I'd had in months (yes, even as a pregnant lady), and needless to say we were back at Workshop within the week.... then again the next week two or three times, and the following week, same story..  And so it became that that by the time baby arrived, we were on a first name basis with the chef, hostess, and most of the wait staff, and we'd eaten our way through most of the menu. 

The good news is, the menu changes: It keeps a rhythm with what's growing outside (Literally, there's a garden on the other side of the window....and also, beehives on the roof!) and ingredients are fresh. 

The meals are wholesome, the portion sizes tend to be perfect, and they contain veggies - yummy amazing veggies! (A tip from the wise: you want a whole bowl of fried brussels sprouts. And you'll still be talking about them the following week too. You may even come back just for them!) 

Beyond the food, other things I like about Workshop:
- The service is incredibly attentive (I drink lots of water and they keep the glass full) 
- The setting is intimate. It can be the perfect place for a romantic date or a girl's night out (be sure to make reservations if you're planning either)
- The pricing is very reasonable.
- There's a chef's table option! (Talk to Chef Paul about organizing this, and be prepared to have your socks knocked off!) 

To conclude, the little one arrived later in March, and his first outing was Easter Brunch at Workshop. We've brought family along, recommended it to friends, and when we get out, it  still continues to be our favourite restaurant!",2016-07-17 04:37:04,-0.17369454,-0.43617958,-0.3834775

A young man who worked there (I think  it's the owner's son) was an amazing help. He showed me everything, answered questions, and made sure that by the time my dog left, she looked like a million bucks. My dog liked him and he made me feel welcome.

I was so impressed that I went back today and instead of the cheapest service (which is what I had the first time), I went with the Deluxe package which was supposed to include everything.

This time, though, the nice young man was busy with a cat & I was left with the owner, Alan. Alan, unlike his son, was an unfriendly, unhelpful, and even belligerent jerk. Not only would he not voluntarily help with anything, he acted totally put-out even showing me how his shop's clippers worked. His attitude seemed to be somewhere between F-U and tough luck. 

After about 10 minutes of trying to clip my dog with a blade that wasn't up to snuff, and getting no help from Alan, I told him that this wasn't going to work for me and it looked like I'd have to go to Petco. He took my debit card and said he was going to charge me the full fee, even though I hadn't yet bathed, brushed, cut, or done anything else to my dog. 

At that point, I decided if I was going to have to pay for it, I might as well try to muddle through. Alan spent all of about two minutes trying to help, which he did silently and with a hostile attitude. Long story short -- my dog left the place looking terrible. She was unhappy to be there and I have never felt as unwelcome or uncomfortable at a business -- ever. 

I would suggest that before anyone else go there, they check to see who's working and if it's Alan, don't go. He's a man who either hates his job or just hates people. Luckily, his son doesn't take after him, which is the best thing I can say about Spike's.",2013-04-12 00:17:18,-1.3573865,-0.68602604,0.14574279

It's in the space that was formerly Epiphany Restaurant, and is under the same ownership and management. I guess they decided to go in a different direction and name.

The folks are the same, but the menu is different. Sort of fancy traditional American mixed with California cuisine. It's not just mac and cheese but truffle mac and cheese. 

The soft opening was anything but! The doors opened at 6 and it was packed by 7. There is a good level of cougers and douchebags there, and HobNob appears to have anticipated that, and offer a signature drink called a Couger Cooler. 
What was soft about the opening was a limited menu, which they were very upfront about so we were well aware that the kitchen was still preparing and the staff was getting oriented. Parts of the restaurant were even still under construction.

I was there with thirsty friends and we sampled three cocktails: the Hunny Sunshine (or sunset?), with muddled ginger , the Old Pom with bourbon and pomegranate syrup, and the Cucumber Crush with, you guessed it, crushed cucumber! Of these three, we liked the Old Pom and the Cucumber best. 

Nibbles included a selection of bread rolls - rosemary, sundried tomato and plain - with a fat wodge of butter, and an appetizer order of the Mac Daddy, their spiral pasta with cheese sauce and toasted crumb topping flavored with truffle. 

The guys at the bar, Andy and Ace, were kept on their toes with many many drink orders, they stayed organized and even added a little flourish here and there.

I had the ""brick,paper,scissors"" martini and it was so refreshing and delicious that I had to get a second with my entree. The table shared an order of the ""bricklayer"" nachos and they were okay, but the house-made salsa on the side was out of this world. For my entree I got the ""bird and pig"", based on so many great Yelp recommendations. It did not disappoint with thick, crispy bacon, sweet apples and agave nectar, tasty chicken and delicious pressed ""sweet"" bread.

Ballyhoo Grill is one of those restaurants that has survived forever, in good times and bad.  Their food has also had those same swings - both good and bad, but overall, it is certainly okay. If you are not in a time crunch, and you're in the area, it might be worth a trip.

My most recent trip, I visited with a party of six.  Right from the start, we asked for bread, since they heat it up fresh. We didn't actually get that bread and olive oil to dip in until we had our lunch. I had the blackened grouper sandwich with rice and black beans for my meal.  It was fine, although overall not much flavor, even though the fish was blackened, served on a fresh bun, with a generous portion of rice and beans. 

Another member of my party had a salad with tuna, and I would not order that for myself. Bagged iceberg lettuce, with a few pieces of seared tuna on it, and saturated in dressing. I will say that the tuna looked fresh; one of my past experiences, which lead to me not eating here for years, was being served gray, yes gray, tuna!  ICK!

Service was friendly but slow, even though we had an experienced waitress. Food also took a while to come out.  Rounded up because the food was better than my previous visit, but it still has a way to go.",2017-05-03 13:27:43,0.41878676,-0.43603826,-0.39305696

So, the dishes really were tasty but somehow just didn't induce those ""mmms"" I expect from a great restaurant. The portions are way too small for the prices and the flavors aren't as complex as you'd hope. 

My best advice is if you're actually from the South, don't go here expecting to find the haven for damn good southern food that you've been waiting for.

After scouring the dimly lit side streets and the overpriced cafes on state I stumbled upon a good cup of coffee. Delicious red eyes, coffee, an eclectic tea collection, and I don't say this lightly. THE BEST CROISSANT in the 805. 

First a little about moi. I am a noted croissant specialist who has munched on pastries from Paris to Brussels to Omaha and I know a thing or two about France's favorite breakfast. Good cup has manifested a croissant with a brilliantly flaky outer layer which upon the first bite reveals a soft, fresh, delectable middle. Peets coffee and Starbucks obviously lack in their pastry game due to the frozen garbage they parade around as food and the French press provides a croissant with adequate flakiness but just not the same dough. The only place which rivals good cup for its bread quality is d'angelos bakery which has the sb bread game on lock down. 

While it is shameful that there are no coffee shops in this town other than Starbucks open past 10pm on most nights, if you happen to walk past good cup when it is open please head in. You will be greated by an always friendly customer service team, a low key and relaxing ambiance, great beverages, and the best damn pastries and gelato around.",2015-02-24 16:03:34,0.17615277,0.32389948,0.058922607

A little background... I have psoriasis, it's on my legs and hands and whenever I get a mani/pedi I try to explain to them that it's not contagious and that it doesn't hurt when they massage it, usually that's all I have to say. When I first sat down and rolled up my pants I tried explaining what it was, instead of saying okay and giving me my mani/pedi, there was one guy that went on and on about it. Asking me questions like ""do you see a doctor?"" and ""how long have you had it?"" and he also said ""you need to go see a different doctor because it will go away"" and ""you need to put oil on it"". I've had psoriasis for 10 freakin' years, I think I'd know what I needed to do! Now, I can't understand Chinese or Japanese or whatever the heck they're speaking but I can understand body language and it was obvious they were talking about me which bothered me even more. Finally the ""psoriasis talk"" subsided and the man went and worked on someone else. There was a new girl that came over to work on my hands and I had to explain it all over again, luckily she was a little nicer about it. After my nails and toes were finished I was waiting for my nails to dry and to my astonishment the employee sitting in front of me was PICKING HER NOSE!!!! I was appalled to say the least! And then my worst nightmare came true, when my nails were finished drying she came over, took my hand and rubbed alcohol over the top (I had gels done). I couldn't help but feel like I was going to throw up. I immediately got up and washed my hands and got out of there as quickly as possible.

My friend & I came in half an hour before they closing and received excellent service without feeling rushed at all. The owners and their friends were at the bar socializing and it made it feel very friendly and family like hearing their german tales, some in german, and their laughter. 

So we both had to get a German Beer, served in a nice big stein. Thank you. They serve Spaten, either Dunkel, Lager or Pilsner as well as Franziskaner Weissbier               

Each meal comes with an interesting salad topped with beets, beans, cabbage and a sour cream dressing.Really good and different. 

For dinner I had the pork schnitzel 9$17.90) with a side of jaeger sauce (offered by our helpful server-Thank you!) served with lyonnais potatoes and mixed vegis. The schnitzle was perfectly done. Cooked to a nice crisp without being overcooked or tough. The potatoes were delicious too. I don't know what they do to them to make them so good but wow! 

Friend had the Jaeger Schnitzle with spaetzle and it was very good as well ($17.90 as well) Perfectly made, the spaetzle was so good with the jaeger sauce. 

The decor here is very old fashiohned. Very 80's with mauve and green but it's very clean and well kept. Felt like having dinner at my german grandmothers house, well without the yelling!

I really liked the fact that the staff person asked me if I wanted a receipt or not, if I wanted a bag or not, if I wanted things to stay or to go, if I wanted my bread sliced or not, and confirmed precisely what I wanted before I bought it.

Food isn't cheap here, but unlike other Edmonton specialty bakeries, the fare is pretty much universally whole grain, and the bread selection isn't completely whittled down to nothing after the end of a weekday, even though it might only be open until 6pm.

My friends and I wanted to find a sit-down breakfast joint that opened early enough for us to chow down on good food before my friend had to go to work. After browsing through Yelp, it seemed like Ghini's was the only candidate nearby. Although their door and website state that they opened at 6:30am, they seemed to be running late and didn't open until 6:45am. We had to seat ourselves and waited on a server for a few minutes. Eventually, our waiter came and, being slightly flustered, took our orders quickly. I was surprised to find that you can't order every single pastry from the bakery display on the other end of the cafe (apparently, they're separate businesses?) For example, you can only order plain croissants if you sit at a table, but you can choose from a variety of croissants if you walk yourself over to the pastry counter (strange). Anyway, I ordered the Egg Provençal with scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast. It really did seem like I had an overcooked order of 6 eggs - just a huge portion off rubbery sadness! (You might be better off ordering the eggs over easy).  The toast was overly buttered as well, which is fine if you like it that way. The only good thing I had was their cafe au lait, which was served in a huge mug. My friend had the breakfast sandwich, and she thought it was decent. With just a few tweaks, Ghini's can be great, but I'm afraid I'd go elsewhere for breakfast or brunch.",2014-07-30 02:32:39,0.12562992,-0.6474588,-1.4838426

 After the raucous afternoon at the Rams game I decided that an agreeable meal was in order. Eschewing the Ruth Chris chain experience, I figured that Carmine's Steakhouse would offer a more uniquely ""Saint Louis"" feel. To be forthcoming it really feels like a Hotel Restaurant (as it is) which in and of itself is not a particularly bad thing, it is just the service was a bit stiff and forced for my liking. Also, the interior is quite dated.

The menu is about as stereotypical as Steak House dining gets and all of the usual suspects in Midwestern dining are well represented. The local favorite ""Toasted Ravioli"" was my first order in and is came to the table at breakneck speed. Basically it is the same as any Ravioli, just twice the size and Breaded and deep fried. Considering the great hype surround the dish i was honestly underwhelmed. It basically tasted like an amalgamation of Ground Beef, grease and Marinara with a bit of crunchy mouth feel mixed in. Ho hum at best but I came for steak, so it was not a deal killer at that point. 

As for the Steak, Carmine's does put out a very solid 21 day aged Bone-In Ribeye when they get the temperature right. On the kitchen's first attempt my Steak came to the table still eating the salad. After returning it to the kitchen (I loathe doing this), a perfectly marbled 20 ounce piece of charred delight came to my table seared to order (medium rare) along with Steak Butter on their second try. Returning meat to a kitchen in a Steakhouse always irks me, but at least they erred to the side of caution.  

As I side I ordered the Twice Baked Potato which was rather uninspired and boring thanks too being under-seasoned. 

In closing, Carmine's Steakhouse is probably a pass for future visits if and when I get back to Saint Louis as there are several other Chop Houses in the area that deserve a fair shake before a return trip. 2 stars and moving on.",2014-10-29 13:19:15,0.011074747,-0.26311165,-0.36157772

We went before an ATC play- had a lovely window table. Hostess Crista was welcoming- no pretention here! Our server Anthony gets my vote for ""best in Tucson"". He did an excellent job of offering up the details of the menu and included some of his 'favorite menu items'.
Service was quick and efficient........now, for the important part.....what an amazing value (especially the taco plate).................
I had the limeade and my dining partner had the Prickly Pear iced tea.

Torn between several menu items....I ordered the Chile Relleno and, it was the best one I've ever had! I also ordered a couple of their freshly handmade corn tortillas to go with the side of frijoles negros that come with the entrée....warm and fresh!

My dining partner had a taco plate.....and was thrilled with every bite.

And, I came back the next night and sat at the bar for supper before a concert at The Fox. This time I tried the taco plate and chose a carne asada (not your usually chopped up bits but tender and moist shreds of beef) and the carnitas taco...as good as the best restaurant in Mexico City or the best of any street food............

I splurged and ordered the churro for dessert......I'll let you be surprised but it was a dessert plate that left me speechless! 

Bryan was my server that night.....great job! I sat at the bar and got to watch the magic of Chef Stella and her line cooks/Sous.....she had a smile on her face and was dancing through with amazing choreography of turning out what must now be the best food in Tucson.

A taco plate with two fresh sides (choose from at least 5 freshly made items) is only $12!  The roasted fingerling potatoes were amazing as well as the freshly sauted Calabacitas.....

Salsa and Fresh Chips are a treat....complimentary.....just the right blend of fresh and spice.

I would give them a negative if I could. Pizza is 1 star quality. Really only good for late night when you're drunk, but hey that's one thing. It's another thing to have the rudest staff on state street. 

Fraternity Pizza: 
I waited 20 minutes, went up and asked if they called my number that I must have missed and they said no. They called 7 numbers ahead of mine at this point. Waited another 25 minutes, still no number called. When I went up again they said the ticket was 2 hours long and was accusing me of trying to get more. (Ticket said 12:56, it was 1:40am). I know my pic on here may say otherwise, but I'm no guy that's gonna slam 2 giant pieces of pizza and go up and try to get more, I'd go home and pass the fuck out. They were swamped so I get it, I've worked in the industry before. When asked if I could simply just get a refund or another order made they refused. I asked to speak with a manager (who apparently is also the cook). He told me he had a lot of people in line to worry about and proceeded to yell at me and how it was my fault. He also said I shouldn't have waited 2 hours to ask about it. Again I'm no mathematician, but it was now a full hour after arguing for 15 min trying to get things right. Him and 2 other people, one who was working the front and another cook proceeded to put their hands on me and tell me to leave. Note: I didn't raise my voice once or put my hands on anyone. Then I had drunk people butting in telling me it's only pizza, yada yada yada. Which it is, not that big of a deal, but it's simply the merit of making sure your customers get what they paid for. I felt like I was at a fraternity. 

Now I get it, it's known as a place for drunk people so I know they deal with some shit. But to simply push and yell at your customer out the door, because of your mistake will not keep you in business long. At least I hope not, Santa Barbara deserves better on State.

I thought he was going to propose at a restaurant and then when he asked me to select a restaurant, I picked The Farm and Fisherman since it had great reviews online and sounds like they use the freshest ingredients. Our waittress was very kind and asked us if we were celebrating and I said we were celebrating Joe proposing to me and the waittress was so excited for us.
We started off with a beet salad which came highly recommended. It was delicious! and refreshing! a great way to cleanse the palate and start our meal.

The other appetizer we split was a braised beef short rib with gnocchi. This was delicious! A bit more savory and filling than our other appetizer, but I love hot appetizers and braised beef short rib so this was the perfect choice for us.

Joe got the cod fish dish with a sweet pea puree. He really enjoyed his dish, and I'm not a huge fan of fishy-fish dishes but this one was a great dish! The fish was cooked to a nice crisp exterior and juicy flaky interior.

I had the steak dish with a corn mash and roasted veggies. The steak dish was terrific but I really enjoyed the corn on the side.

Our waittress brought out this dessert trifle on the house in honor of our proposal. This was a really nice dessert but I was super happy that we had ordered this other dessert dish:

As mentioned above, a 15% gratuity is added to every bill, no matter the size of your party. Just something to note as your bill will still have a ""tip"" line and does not indicate in any manner that it's an additional tip. 

My wife and I stopped here for lunch after walking around the square looking at all of the art. There was no wait and we were told to just pick a table. 

Somebody walked by and just dropped 2 menus on the table without saying anything. Our waitress walked up about 15 seconds later with a ""what can I get ya"" while looking over at the bar and not at us. Not a ""Hello"" or anything either. I told her that we just sat down and would need a few minutes to look over the menu. She didn't say a word and just walked off. 

A few minutes later she returned and we ordered the fish po'boy and the creole combination. The food came out fairly quickly since it wasn't busy at all. The po'boy was dripping with oil and grease, so much that it soaked the bread. The white rice on my plate was cold as if it had been sitting for 15+ minutes. The red beans and seasoned rice on my plate was lukewarm. The jambalaya had cooled to a point where it was a mushy consistency. The sausage in it was just plain gross. We both ended up getting sick about an hour after lunch. 

The waitress came by once to refill our tea and then to drop off the check. Never to ask how the food was. 

I'm assuming the automatic 15% gratuity is added because the average would likely be less than that if the service we received is the norm. 

It's unfortunate that the service and food were both so bad as this restaurant is in a prime location. All of the patrons were definitely tourists. The locals must know better.

I understand their philosophy behind this, but as a business decision in my opinion it is not sustainable over the long haul. They are artificially limiting their potential market, even though the trend is towards a plastic society. This in of itself is not a deal breaker for me, but I would not frequent this establishment as much as one that accepts cash. So I ordered the Mexican  Corn Elote Bowl and added chicken for a total of $13.00. Now I don't mind paying this for a salad if the quality is good ( which it was), and appetizing (which it also was)
but the question was "" where's the goat cheese and  chicken"" I accounted for three bites of goat cheese and about 4 small cubes of chicken. The rest was dominated by greens.

So I understand it's the city and spaces are smaller but their bathroom area is TINY with little to no privacy. It's beautiful but not that relaxing as you're trying to wind down and get in your robe. And the sitting are while waiting is just right there. wide open to people getting off the elevators. No one offered me a drink so I went to serve myself, in my robe and too small slippers, which was right next to the front desk where people were schlepping in to get gift cards and such. Nobody let me know what was first and what the timing was between services, nothing. I heard the facials here are incredible so I was very excited. This was my first facial but I didn't see the big deal. Then I went back to the open waiting room and was just sitting there and after almost 15 mins I was taken back for a 1 hour massage, which I had paid extra to get a deep tissue instead of a swedish. The person had no idea what she was doing. She just took hot stones and rubbed them up and down. It was terrible. After that, I figured I should probably ask when the next service started so I wasn't just sitting there. so I used the steam shower and sauna. both very nice. they told me to change into my clothes for the mani pedi. so I did and then went over to the nail area. it was fine. I don't think it was the greatest job. And they don't even have a proper drying area. I was told to just sit in the chair and wait for 15-20 mins for my toes to dry. It got to the point where I went over to the woman and was like, am I done? And she asked someone to get an oil (a quick dry oil?) which never came and so I asked someone myself for the oil and she took me in the bathroom to put on my toes and then put seran wrap because I was putting socks on. and when I got home the polish on a couple toes had smudged.

I also had a shrimp quesadilla, which was really delicious, due to the spices they put on the shrimp,  nice blend of pepper and other unknown spices.

The two things I will surely go back for more of is the Sausage and Pepper Pizza (capitalized - because I mean business) and some sort of puff pastry that has a white cream in the middle - I'm sure it has a name but it escapes me.  The pizza was perfectly flavored and the sausage/peppers had a nice kick to it.  Im sure it would make for great leftovers but unfortunately (fortunately?) for me it was gone well before it found the refrigerator.  The cream puff cream was just awesome - couldn't pin-point the flavor (vanilla?) but I would prefer it to top every dessert I get from this point forward.

I also got a bunch of the other sweets (salted brownie, blondie, red velvet crumb-cake) and a few bagels.  All were good, but not great.  Was pleasantly surprised by the wheat everything bagels - whole wheat bagels usually suck.

What I didn't really like was the pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty bland for my liking - in complete contrast to the sausage and pepper pizza - and the pepperoni was pretty sparse. I also didn't like being told 25 minutes, showing up in 25 minutes and then standing there for 25 minutes waiting for the pizza.  The small shop + no chairs = awkwardly standing there for almost a half hour.  

Since it's close to me and has so many tasty looking treats yet to try - I'll surely be back.  Hopefully I'll get more 'great' than 'so-so'.",2013-09-04 00:55:48,-0.1774342,-0.4362995,0.3393916

Ordered some chips and salsa as they are not complimentary.  The salsa was a nice fire roasted salsa with a touch of heat. Decided to get some queso as well and it was a very weak example of queso. Made with mozzarella so it was very stringy and although tasted eh ok belonged more on a pizza than a tortilla chip. 

For dinner scott ordered the tinga tacos. ..spicy chicken 3 per order.  PeM had the churassco ..served with rice and beans and an odd folded tortilla with green salsa on it... and I had the enchiladas with red green and white sauce.

Good location, easy to get to.  Greeted by the valet with courtesy and the front desk staff were super friendly and helpful.  Lobby oozes decadence and a cool vibe with the bar and restaurant on the first floor as well.  This is an old building so at least my room was a tad small vs some of the more opulent rooms in other Indigo's I've stayed at across the country, however, it was well appointed, clean and comfortable.

A few knocks ... I appreciate the eclectic nature of the Indigo brand but the old school elevators still operating like old school elevators was slightly unnerving (the cars kinda jerk around as you go up, hold on to something...).  The bathroom shower was a ""walk-in"" but the 1/2 wall where you stand was not long at all - and not nearly long enough to keep the water from splashing out onto the floor outside the shower.  The wife had drug the towel/mat over that way and it was soaked by the time she was finished.  The floor is also quite slippery when wet - be careful!  Only one Keurig cup of coffee left in the room - it's the little things in a place like this, right?  The room was nice, but the regular retail price ...

And really I'd rate this four stars, however, at $369 a night on a Thursday night type rate I'd like more.  That may honestly just be a function of the lack of quality downtown hotel rooms in Nashville, but $369 a night I'm looking for a more suite like situation.  I stayed here using a freebie from my IHG platinum elite rewards program, but if I were staying downtown and paying the rate myself I'd be shopping around for a better rate - and may or may not find one, just my feeling.",2018-04-27 18:37:33,-1.11578,0.84607816,-0.5520315

Justin Shores is a great new employee that really takes the time to be empathetic, genuine and actually care about what is going on. I felt that he took care of me during the service process and really tried his hardest to help. Manuel is extremely kind, nice and helpful. Even when I was bummed out at the dealership he is such a happy person he'd make me smile. I'm sure there are other great employees but these two really helped me out substantially.

I was super excited to eat a gyros sandwich and check out this local cafe that somehow had slipped my eye all these years. When I first went in, I was fully geared up to order the gyros sandwich, but then I saw the menu and spent a good 5 minutes debating whether or not I should change my mind. The manager (I think) was really patient and offered up some recommendations, and I ended up getting a pita melt with turkey instead. This would just give me an excuse to come back another time to try the gyros.

The pita was great and immediately made me a repeat customer, as I came back a few days later. I love how the restaurant is run by a family and how friendly and talkative they are every time I'm here. The place is never really crowded, as I think most people come here to grab food to go, but its nice to have the option to eat in.

On days that I wanted to trick myself into thinking I was eating healthier, I would order a gyros salad which provided the satisfaction of eating a gyro but with significantly more veggies.

I love Blackberry Cafe especially since it falls in line with my goal of supporting local dining locales. The service and friendliness also really helps. Just expect a brief wait for your food as they prep it when you order so everything comes out fresh. Also, the parking can be a problem since Blackberry Cafe shares a small metered lot with three other places.

I just moved to Manayunk a month ago, and wanted something delivered for the first time here. After reading all the reviews about how great it was, I decided to go with the Falafel platter with a lemonade. It was a bit pricey at 19 and change (not including tip), but I didn't mind the price too much because the rave reviews were in the back of my mind. 

The food took an hour and fifteen minutes to get to my house. I'm willing to give them a pass on that, because 1) they told me it could take up to an hour, and 2) I ordered at 6:30 on a Saturday night. 

The food itself: The hummus was your average hummus, pretty good. The sides of tabouleh and lettuce/onion/tomato were good. The falafel was decent, but a bit too hard for my liking. The pita is where it all went wrong. The pita was not at all fluffy or soft. It was too thin, and almost too tough to bite through. A real disappointment cause they gave me a lot of it. Maybe I'll make some pita chips out of them though... So there was really no point in wrapping the falafel and fix-ins inside the pita because it was too hard to bite into. 

I was soo hungry and it was too expensive to not eat, yet I didn't finish all of it. I'm hoping it'll make for some above-average eats when I come home later tonight after a night at the bars. 

I woulda given it 2, but I ended up giving it 3 stars because 1) maybe I just got one of the rare bad meals, 2) I didn't wanna bring the ratings down too much because people really seem to love this place, 3) they were very nice on the phone, and 4) maybe it's a lot better when you eat there.

I've been in the Lawrence, Nora, Glendale, and Central (downtown) branches, and the Lawrence and Nora branches are my least favorite. But since this review is about the Lawrence branch, I'll focus it on that: 

I've only been inside the Lawrence branch four or five times, mainly to renew my library card, or because I found something particular online and placed it on hold and had to go pick it up. The Lawrence Branch is sparse, and it's common to see entirely empty shelves. That's sad because I'm used to browsing by subject, but there's just not much there to browse, and much of what is there is old and outdated and appears to be donations that were probably rejected by Half Priced Books. It could be a function of lack of funding, or a combination of limited funding and appropriating the funding towards the demographic the library now serves. That demographic seems to be people who do not have any/reliable internet access at home (the library has a sign in the entrance that says ""free wi-fi"", and there are several computer terminals that appear to be for internet use), people who want to rent DVDs and CDs, and people who want to download ebooks and not deal with physically searching and carrying books and remembering to return them before the due date. I get that, and I get that as a Kindle user, I'm part of the problem.

I will start upon arriving at the facility: The valet staff should probably wear smiles and act as if we as guests are not an inconvenience. After all, this is there job. Easily dismissed though as everyone can have a less than great day. It was also 1:00AM local time. 

Upon entering the hotel (I refuse to refer to it as a resort which I'll explain later) I was awestruck by the beauty of the lobby and the gardens at the opposite end. This is of course where the pleasurable experience stopped, abruptly. Upon check in we were rudely greeted by a gentleman telling me my room rate was incorrect and it would be $100 higher than my reservation. Despite it being late, I calmly asked why the discrepancy? He couldn't advise me of a straight answer and of course no management staff was available. I had asked for other facilities in the area to which I was informed they were all booked. I'm curious as to know how he knew such a thing! Reluctantly, I checked in and was immediately billed $100 more per night for 3 nights, 3 days worth of parking at $23/day and an $18/day resort fee. Surprise!! I didn't have a choice in the matter because they hit my card with all of it right then and there. I advised him I would be speaking with a manager the following morning. Surprise again! No manager was available all 3 days! 

I left the front desk to find our room. And it was the worst hunt I had ever been on in my life. It took 30 minutes to find the room and the little river that runs through the atrium smelled something horrible. After wandering through the jungle we emerged in the Delta Region. I think that is somewhere in South Africa, but I'm unsure. Onto the next adventure! We were told 1 room number but our keys said another. Since I was advised verbally, we chose that one. Keys didn't work. Tried the one on the card and voilà, the doors opened: to a horribly small room with 2 double beds which had a peculiar odor to it. Now for the luggage. We used the ""Consider it Done"" button on the phone (which by the way I believe it said Consider it Done OUR Way, but I could be mistaken). The bellhop brought the luggage 25 minutes later. I think he got lost too. It's now 2:00AM and time to hit the hay and see Nashville! 

At 8:30AM someone is brutally banging on our door. By the nature of the banging I would have thought it to be the Feds! Apparently Housekeeping doesn't pay attention to the little guitar shaped ""Do Not Disturb"" card. I'm awake now...and I want coffee! The coffee maker doesn't work. The iron didn't work. Ok. There's a cafe somewhere amongst the foliage! I saw it marked on the map. They should probably include a legend on said map. $8 for an overpriced knockoff Starbucks, but ok, it's Nashville and a local tourist trap. 

I'm going to fast-forward a little as to not make this much longer. Despite the pools not being open when they say they are, the restaurants being more expensive than those in airports and with mediocre food at best, being kicked out of the pizza place they had inside 10 minutes before closing and our room had an amazing view of dumpsters with the glorious rolling landscape of a parking lot, it was a nice place! The only saving grace were the gardens themselves. But you can view them without having to pay for a room! 

Now for the really fun part: Contacting Marriott Customer Care about the horrible visit. (The hotel won't call you back otherwise.) Customer Care advised me they would forward my grievance to the hotel and I should expect a response in 3-5 business days. I forwarded everything I could think of including my original reservation, costs, incorrect information and of course the issues we had while staying there. 

I was eventually contacted by a Heather Gates who is the Assistant Front End Manager. She informed me she was sorry for the way we were treated but they would not do anything to rectify the bill. That's the way it was. I contacted Marriott Customer Care again and copied Heather on this email. I was then phoned by John Bennefield, the Front End Manager who informed me the exact same thing as Heather ""Sorry, but you're stuck with that bill."" Furthermore he refused to give me the hotel manager's name, phone or email. Instead I was informed of his 15 years with the company and this was his 8th hotel! From working in a large company, when someone was transferred so frequently, we called it ""Passing the Trash"". It definitely wasn't due to pride of service. John was exceptionally rude and went on to belittle me for making such a huge deal and contacting customer care over a mere $300. To me, that's reasonably substantial. I was also informed directly that ""The Marriott considers this matter closed. It ends here and there's nothing more anyone will do."" I had asked for the hotel managers number, name or email to which he told me ""you can find it online"".",2015-09-02 23:24:51,-1.5376965,0.32917535,-0.8300346

But to give Whole Foods some credit some of their prices beat the prices of Superfresh. Regardless you will wind up spending a lot on a little when you shop here. My suggestions are: 

- Shop for specialty items only that you cannot find in other grocery stores
- Skip the produce, buy else where (unless you need your organic stuff) 
- I'm a huge fan of the bulk section- really cheap for oats, seeds, etc. nuts are pretty expensive. 
- If you're looking for a not so cheap quick, fresh, healthy meal come here. I love the salad bar (especially the tofu). More recently they added a grilled seasonal vegetable section which includes eggplant, portabellos, squash, zucchini, etc. it's so yummy! 
- They usually have pretty good deals on fresh fish and their poultry prices are average. 

One huge complaint is that they have a small selection of fresh ground fresh nut butters (at least compared to the Plymouth Meeting location). The almond butter machine is always broken and has been gone for the past couple of months. I recently went in yesterday and it was to my surprise back up.

The spring rolls were delicious dipped in the wasabi mayo or simply eaten alone.

Spicy Braised Pork Noodle Soup: This was really good. Wasn't as spicy as I would like, but it was perfect for a cold night. The braised pork was really good and the soup was really flavorful. 

Stinky Tofu: To my surprise, this was actually really good. Maybe because it was deep fried. Regardless, it definitely taste better than it sounds. Even if you don't normally like tofu, I would give this a try. The dipping sauce is good as well.

Braised Beef over Rice: I liked this dish as well. It was really simple since it pretty much just had two things, but it was tasty. 

Oyster Pancake: I was really excited about this one, but then found it to be really weird. The oyster was covered into this really weird slimy batter and the oysters were really small and they didn't give much of them. The rest of the pancake was just ehh... I would pass on this one.

Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don't show they'll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn't ask me anything about myself, didn't tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.

Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I'm giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it's safe to say this is the worst wax I've ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine's Day! I understand they can't get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  
I'm about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. 

The staff- Another reason why I won't be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don't like being asked if I'm going to tip - can't you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much?

Overall it was an enjoyable experience. We chose this hotel because it was one of two full service hotels in downtown Boise and the only one that had suites plus great rates. The lobby décor was rather dated but cozy. The location was convenient to just about everything in downtown Boise, including some really good restaurants.

We had a tower suite located on the thirteenth floor, which is the top hotel floor. There are two additional stories which are private residences. The suite bedroom had plenty of space with two double beds (matresses need replacing), a large closet, a flat screen TV and a large window overlooking south downtown Boise. The living area had two overstuffed chairs, a couch that had a pull out bed, another flat screen TV, a desk and a large window overlooking east Boise. The kitchen area had a small sink, a compact refrigerator (not a mini bar fridge but one for the guest's use) and a small closet. It was the perfect size for us. The one major drawback to the suite was the bathroom. It was not a small bathroom but a ""tiny"" one. There was no room to put anything. I made the mistake of hanging a personal item of clothing on the towel rack and housekeeping threw it in with the towels - never to be seen again. An overweight adult would be very uncomfortable in that bathroom. The tub/ shower combination had a type of spa tub which made the side of the tub higher than a regular tub and there was no grab bar, so getting in to take a shower was very challenging and an accident waiting to happen. Housekeeping kept the room clean and well stocked,

Parking was super convenient. We had the self-parking option which was seven dollars a day. We just took an elevator from the lobby down one floor to a single level garage. There were always plenty of available spaces. The garage is well lit and secure with an attendant on duty at all times at the only exit / entrance. We were glad we chose the self-park over the valet.

We had breakfast every morning at Emilio's. The food was OK and the service was usually pretty good. The lobby bar was attractive and had very fair drink prices for a hotel. We encountered two bartenders during our stay - the male was great and we learned a lot about Boise from him but the female was rather unpleasant and we just avoided the bar when she was on. One of the things mentioned on the hotel website is the Zone sports bar which we were really looking forward to trying but the hotel staff informed us it is only open during the hockey team's home games. That was disappointing to us and the hotel should update their website information. We did not use the fitness facilities.

.All in all, it was a good stay and should we find ourselves in Boise again we would probably stay here again.",2012-10-13 22:32:02,-0.8026282,0.6765153,-1.2405599

My only complaint about this place was that for the longest time it was impossible to get nutrition information and I felt they were evasive about it, which is counter intuitive for a place that trades on freshness. However, it is now available (most likely required to expand into California).  Most combos are going to run you near 1000 calories before the bread and strawberry and up into the day's allotment of sodium.  Not better or worse than many lunch-oriented quick service restaurants.  Armed with that information, you can make your choices.  It is reasonably priced for what you get in my opinion and is really fast.  Even when lines are long they move quickly.  It can be a little nerve-wracking for a first timer, but it is efficient.

Food: the food was decent. We got snow crab and shrimp, with the Whole She'bang flavor, in XXX spice. I love spicy food, and I'll say their hot definitely had some spice to it. I may get 3 stars next time, instead of 4, just to taste more of the flavor, but the XXX was hot to the point of just heat. The crab was definitely better than the shrimp. The shrimp they use for the headless is a lot smaller than the shrimp for the head on. (Yes, I realize it'll be smaller without the head, but they seem to actually use different shrimp.)  My friend ordered it with heads on. The shrimp seemed a lot fresher, in addition to being larger. I had headless, and some of them were pretty mushy, and generally just not great. My friend ordered a side of Cajun fries, and it was hard to tell there was any ""Cajun"" to it. There were a couple of fries with some seasoning on them, but literally just a few. Friend tried to order beer, but they said they don't have a liquor license. Ok, that's fine. I tried to order soda, they said they didn't have that yet either. So, they're menu is still in work. 

Service: this is really what knocked the stars down. The hostess and the manager (I think he was the manager?) were really nice. The other folks sometimes seemed bothered to be asked for anything, and seemed pretty overwhelmed. We had to repeat our order 3 times, and we didn't get anything crazy. We watched as they consistently delivered food to the wrong tables. They even took my drink back to refill, and took it to another table and left it there. When I mentioned that, the server said ""oh, I'll just get you another water, it's fine"" missing the point that the cup I had been drinking out of was given to another customer. I got up and went and got my drink from the other table, but it was weird. 

Overall, this place definitely has potential. I've gone to similar style places throughout the country, so I do have somewhat high standards. The Mad Crab was more expensive and the quality wasn't quite what it's been at other places, but I also realize we're in the middle of St Louis, but overall food-wise, I would probably give it a 3-3.5.

Small, but good!
 
I started off with the Gumbo Ya Ya which was very flavorful and had a nice spiciness to it.  Some other places don't have that kick I like in a gumbo.  It's just enough to let you know it's there!  My favorite of the trip (out of 3 places).  My wife ordered the Veal Milanese which was super tender and had a nice crust on it.  Very flavorful as well as we always try each other's food.  

After the waiter put on my bib, I was able to get to the main event.  The Barbecue Shrimp were delicious.  They were a little slippery to get the heads and shells off (yes, they're shell on), but using two hands got the job done.  Had to dip the shrimp in the sauce after peeling, and my hands were getting messy.  The bread in the sauce is also quite delicious.  I preferred the bread they brought before the meal in the juices over the softer bread they brought with the meal.
 
As I was finishing, they brought over a hot, wet towel with lemons so I could clean myself up.  That was a nice touch that I wasn't expecting.  My wife ordered the Pecan Pie for dessert and it was also pretty tasty.  The inside was dark and sweet and the pecans had a nice soft crunch.  Another good dessert!
 
The service was good as well as the gentlemen tending to our table were always nearby if we needed anything.

 The Symphony offers a ticket package for young professionals and students at a severely discounted rate. The program is called Wave Length. Being under 30 we decided to participate and buy a complete package for the classical series, which set us back $150 per person. Seriously amazing price, y'all.  The discounted rate doesn't mean that we have bad seats either, we are sitting in the orchestra towards the middle.

The classical series has been excellent so far this year. The musicians are very good and the pieces have been well played. The concerts are on Friday and Saturday nights. If it's a more popular piece, there is a Thursday performance. 

We ended up getting tickets to Handel's Messiah because we enjoyed the shows so much. The guest conductor did a great job and the choir and musicians were amazing. I can't wait to see it again next year. 

People usually dress up for Symphony performances. I would categorize it as ""Sunday Best"". I usually wear a nice dress or skirt. There is always at least one girl in a full length formal dress. My husband wears a jacket and tie. The center is well heated so don't worry about being cold when you are seated.

I almost don't know where to begin...but let's start with the extraordinarily long line-it's Essence Fest so I get it, lines are everywhere.   But we were 7th on the wait list and waited over 2 hours.  We watch while ""celebrities-not"" breezed in from off the streets to be seated in front of myself and other paying customers who also had been waiting for HOURS for what would be a mediocre meal.  

We were told that the ""owner was hosting them at his private table.""  Problem is the place has 20 tables and a bar so if the owner wanted to pay for or host ""celebrities""  -he/she should've closed for the day.  It's called, ""closed for a private event."" It felt exclusionary and demoralizing.  What happened to valued customer service?

And then I get inside and order and wait, and wait, and wait another hour before food finally arrives.  My sweet potato pancakes were dense-not moist or fluffy and my spinach and feta omelette was unseasoned and light on the feta. Everything was warm-not hot, not cold-just warm.  Did someone forget to grab from the window on time for a hot plate to arrive to my table?  It wasn't just me though the salmon, bananas foster, and shrimp and grits that my friends ordered all arrived warm.  The grits are dense and bland and not at all cheesy-really.

Once half of our order arrived the waitresses disappeared and we were hunting folks down to ask for silverware hot sauce and syrup.  Wait staff seemed uninterested in our polite feedback and dismissive.

What's so special about a Khyber Pass Thursday at 10:30/11pm? It's busy. I like that. It makes me feel like I'm coming home to something happening (though the lady is really all I need =D ). Second - it's consistent. 

They serve up comfort food that is consistently good. The service is consistently nice, and it's always consistently a little cold if you sit by the window in the winter (I could do without that consistency, but that's neither here nor there). On first visit, I didn't think much. After finding a special place in my heart, Khyber Pass has moved up in my ranks.

Great beer selection, great food selection. I'd strongly recommend the grilled chicken po boy or sammy po boy, with sweet potato fries and collard greens. The pulled pork sandwich is nice too, even the vegetarian edition.

No need to get the mac n' cheese, unless you like really buttery mac n' cheese. Beers rotate all the time, but I go for the latest nut brown they've got. If that's out, I'll go for something that's not too hoppy.

The waiter talked us into ordering the small-portioned albeit delectable appetizer after ordering both the Margherita and White pizzas -- and let's face it, he didn't have to try that hard. The Mac n' Cheese was brought to our table alongside our additional house salads which, too, were surprisingly crisp and refreshing. However, they were only a side note to the bursting flavor of the Crispy Mac n' Cheese. 

I consider myself a 'texture' person when it comes to food so I was quite satisfied with the crispness of the outer shell especially when most restaurants with a similar menu item tend to lean toward the soggy side. But that's not all - the mac n' cheese inside the shell was some of the creamiest, richest, and moistest (yes - I hate this word) mac n' cheese I've ever had. The only downside is the portion size which turns out to be only 4 bite-size nuggets. If you're hungry, order two servings (we didn't have any hangups since we ordered two pizzas for our table). It would be nice if CPK increased the portion size to at least 5 bites, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.

Now on to the pizza. Again, we ordered the White and the Margherita pizzas and both were good. As far as I'm concerned, I've had better 'white' pizzas from Domino's and Hot Box (The Big Cheese is the same thing in my book), but CPK's was good enough. I probably wouldn't order it again due to the outstanding menu choices which I also deem to be one of this restaurant's strengths, but my focus remained on the Mac n' Cheese (did I already mention that I liked the Mac n' Cheese?) AND the Margherita pizza. In the realm of Margherita pizzas, this was hands down one of the best I've ever had. It's thin-crusted, light and airy with the perfect blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses that penetrate all the way down to the crust. I liken this pizza to a can of Pringles; once I popped (a slice into my mouth), I just couldn't stop (popping more and more slices). I highly recommend this pizza and if you are adamant about smothering your pizza in cheese, you might want to order extra or something else altogether.

I'll finish with the atmosphere. As most people are already aware, this used to be Alcatraz - a fancy(ish) Brewhouse located inside/outside of the Circle Centre Mall. In my opinion, it doesn't quite fit into my normal expectation for a 'pizza place.' I felt that it was obvious that it used to be occupied by another restaurant and it definitely didn't have that welcome-to-our-extended-family vibe that most sit-in pizza places have. I sort of felt out of place when ordering JUST pizza as if I should've ordered shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, but once again I'm only nitpicking. Our waiter was superb and I never had to wait for a refill. The bathroom was quite dirty during my visit. I don't know if this had to do with the fact that it was the day after the Super Bowl, but the place was pretty dead so I'm going to chalk this one up to laziness. 

Overall, if I'm in the area and have a taste for pizza, I'll probably go back... that's if I'm not drinking and closer to Hot Box down the street.",2012-02-08 19:45:52,0.8732251,-0.92024255,0.41086778

I asked them, ""what are the places that I have to have in Indianapolis? like, if my visit doesn't count if I don't go there [other than st. elmo]""

One of them recommended this place for its bacon flight and extensive liquor available. 

I love how the bartender customized drinks; and they knew - how women don't like to have the same stuff as their girl friends. ha ha ha :P I truly appreciate the extra minute that the bartender spent on me to ask what my preference was. And I like it how I gave him some ideas and he whipped up this delicious cocktail. 

Food wise, my co-worker and I shared the following food:
duck fat fries - $4! (coming from SF - this was real good price)
bone marrow  - $8!!!!! O-M-G (if my co-worker and I were not planning to visit another place for dessert, I think we would have order 2 more of these).
trotter cake - I enjoyed this a lot - it was not only a great snack/small dish to go with beer or drinks, it would be a perfect item to go with a big of rice (yes, I totally imagined about mixing the trotter cake with rice, maybe through in a fried egg as well - when I was having it). this labor intensive/time consuming trotter cake is heavenly. 
bacon flight - WOW - this really lives up to the expectation!!  Lamb bacon and goose bacon and Jowl bacon!! and I love the chocolate ganche that comes with it - perfect compliment. Can I order a pack of each and have those deliver to San Fran? 

I spotted a guy having the chicken wings - that just look oh-so-delicious. 

I only wish I had my Olympus camera with me and take some great pictures.

I got the slammin' salmon and my wife got the crunch.

Way too heavy on the sauce, completely overpowering the crisp fresh veggies and salmon. 

We tried the Japanese fried chicken. Sauce is a little sweet and sour. And the chicken was a little dry. 

We also tried their green tea and lemonade, which were pretty good, but you don't come to a place like this because their green tea and lemonade are their best things on the menu.

I read over some other reviewers comments, and I'm surprised this place received less than 5 stars. This place has only been open 5 weeks people!!! That's why places have soft openings, to iron out the wrinkles. Give them a break!

The ambiance was casual yet upbeat and modern. They owners really went through their design with a fine tooth comb and it shows!

Our dinner was fantastic. We had about 8 adults with 6 screaming kids. The staff handled everything wonderfully. Our orders were brought out as ordered and in a timely manner. I appreciate that they brought the children's orders out first. The manager and owner are parents so its nice they can relate to us! 

Being we had a large party, we were fortunate that everyone ordered something different and we got to sample about 80% of their menu. It was great!

Children:

Chicken tenders and wings. Wings were asked to be prepared without sauce. The seasoning on the wings were perfect enough that it provided enough flavor for the kids innocent pallets. The chicken tenders are non-breaded!!! It was scary at first for the kids but they loved it! Again, healthy yet flavorful. All the parents appreciated that very much!

Adults:

We ordered the wraps, chicken sandwiches, and whole chickens. Some experimented with the extra hot sauces. Those that did said ""Packs the heat with the flavor, unlike Hooters or BDubs which is pretty much straight acid going down your throat!"". The chicken was moist and juicy. The rolls were baked in house. The mango lime sauce was to die for!!!

Sidenote: For the comment-er who compared this place to Chicken House. This isn't a place to get a bucket of fried chicken. This place is where you go for a healthy chicken dinner with authentic flavors. This isn't a wing spot but their flamed grilled wings could beat out any deep fried joint.

I try to pigeon hole the Barbary. I try to list its limits in my head every time I get invited there or a particular night attracts me. I think of every reason I could ever have to not go here (which sometimes works on nights where they charge a cover...covers are easy ways to talk me out of going somewhere sometimes).

but in the end, we all know we go to the Barbary to forget who we are for a couple hours on the dance floor. its way too packed to even see anyone else's moves so you know what...you're free to just throw your body around how ever you want cause no one will ever notice if you've got MJ's moves or are doing your best impression of the Mummers dance. 

they ALWAYS play good stuff here. the dj's are on their A-game. there's guaranteed to be more than one time during a night that you and all of your friends look at each other and through your arms up and give out a little ""AHHHHH!"" because a great, special, gem of a song has just come on.

like i said, it gets pretty packed. and sometimes that's a mood killer for me. sometime the exact opposite, a mood maker.  if you want a nice quiet night, go before 10pm, or on a sunday karaoke night (they have a great selection of songs to belt out while you're chugging those beers by the way...i've been known to bust out Natalie Imbruglia and Dusty Springfield). but if you're ok with getting sweaty and bumping more than a few bodies during the night, this is definitely your place.",2010-05-18 14:45:20,-1.3794669,0.15285306,-0.9341169

I've tried other rib tips in the city, but I always come back to Black Diamond. These are the most tender rib tips I've had here. Sometimes, they almost fall apart.

The barbecue fairies must have sprinkled some of their magic dust into that sauce. I usually get the sweet one. I tried a spicy one years ago and hated it. It was spicy with no flavor, if that even makes sense. I'll stick with the sweet. 

The sides? Meh. The mac and cheese used to be amazing, but now it tastes like noodles and cheap, fake cheese. The baked beans are just okay. They're a bit tangy and sweet. I could take them or leave them. The gumbo? Don't do this to yourself. It wasn't at all what I expected. There's no way that a roux was made. If so, the consistency is way off.

As a creature of habit, I don't know if I'll be able to try the other things on the menu. 

I also tried the Salvadorian Tamale. Compared to a Mexican Tamale, this was a lot more moist and had a lighter, almost sweeter flavor. The meat (pork) was also extremely moist and tender. All in all, it was a yummy success. 

I'm looking forward to future visits. The Bistro is relatively close to my work, so I may just need to treat myself for Friday Office Lunch!

I had looked on yelp through hundreds of restaurants because I wanted to find THE BEST. We discussed old school, new American, tapas, seafood, steaks, pretty much everything. Then we all agreed on Luke. 

We checked into our hotel, grabbed the shuttle and sped over to Luke just in time to catch the end of happy hour. Half price drinks including wine (my fave). We really wanted to make sure we got some of the fifty cent oysters. The hostess and our server made sure with only a few min left we were accommodated! We began with sparkling wine and 2 dozen oysters. Both were amazing. Oysters were full and so fresh. They were served with cocktail sauce, vinegar and enough horseradish to make our eyes water in delight. Our next course we switched to a really awesome white wine (sorry I don't recall the name) but it was suggested by our awesome server. His name is Christopher Doppenschmidt in case you would like to ask for him. I then asked if it would be possible to get the shrimp from the raw bar hot. His response: we can do that! As was his response the whole night. He served he shrimp with local clarified butter. The butter was so amazing. We then tried the blue crab bisque. It is making my mouth water remembering it now. For dinner we shared the ribeye and the jäger snitzel. both were great. There are no words to describe the homemade bernaise for the steak. 

One of the best parts of the night was meeting Brian Katz the General Manager. We all laughed and had fun and he made sure our experience was one not to ever be forgotten. 

This was our second time dining at Luke. It will be hard to go back to Cincy and miss out on the culinary treats of Chef John Besh. We will soon return!",2012-01-06 21:45:29,0.17317802,-0.39580297,-0.575092

I came her last Sunday night. It was late and Tria Cafe Wash West seemed like a good choice since the reviews are through the roof. We had to know how is this possible? Is it really worth the hype on yelp?

Yes.. It is worth the hype.

First, Tria is on a perfect quite city corner. It is rather dreamy. They have a few outside tables (with heaters) too! 

It took us a few minutes to get seated, but once we were the service was on point. We didn't have one server, we had two who consistently checked on us. As soon as one of our glasses was coming to an end, one of them would appear and ask if we would like another or if there is anything else they could get for us. Like I said, the service was on absolute point!

To drink, I had the ""Sunday School"" special which was a champagne that was crisp and kept me wanting more. Not just wanting but successfully getting more... 3 glasses later... I also tried the ginger saison. I think I have a new favorite beer! It was fruity but not too much so. I kid you not, I took a picture of the name of it so I can hunt it down and have it again! However, if these aren't your bag, they have endless wine selections and knowledgeable staff to help you find the perfect beverage.

On to the food. Ohhhh the food. Swoon! 

We started with the Warm Poached Black Mission Figs with Gorgonzola and Prosciutto di Parma. They practically melt in your mouth. Another great tip that the server told us was we should add another fig for 40 cents so that we would have an even amount for splitting. Um, ok server from heaven! Its comments like this that made the service so great! 

Do yourself a favor and get the Pistachio Herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey. I think of all the things we had, this was the highlight. The ricotta was light and left us wanting more. I think I could have had 5 or 6 plates of this. Maybe next time I will? 

As for the main course, I ordered the Claudio Mozzarella Sandwich with Crispy Prosciutto, Piquillo Peppers, Pesto and Garlic Vinaigrette, which was good. I think the two appetizers stole the show though. I was also able to try the American Albacore Tuna Sandwich with Black Olive Tapenade, Piquillo Peppers and Arugula. The tuna was delightful with hints of capers and what tasted a bit like anchovies? 

Finally we finished the meal with the Flourless Chocolate Torta with Blackberries, Espresso Custard, Coffee Crumb and Saba. The best part was the custard! It is a small portion so I wouldn't suggest splitting it with more than one person. However, it is the perfect petite dessert for two to share.

If you've made it this far through the review (thanks for reading!) you'll realize that Tria Cafe Wash West is a fantastic establishment and I would highly recommend it to any friends!",2016-04-13 13:44:38,-0.9282347,0.20788586,-0.44874123

The ambiance inside the restaurant is terrible - they've got some major issues.  First, the bathroom wasn't clean. Then, since it was a cold rainy day I was freezing inside with the fans on and asked them to turn off the fans. They had to pull out a ladder and climb up to the ceiling fans to turn them off. The booths are shoddily put together. The inside looks really run down.  We weren't offered beverages.  Then, a woman worker arrived and proceeded to BLAST, and I mean BLAST the music.  Look, me and my husband were the only people in the restaurant, I felt like she was trying to get us to leave.  First, some really inappropriate song came on - which she changed.

Sure there are other places that offer a good salad, but Grabbagreen really makes sure you can't get distracted by the add ons (like that extra brownie for dessert). I ordered the Gulf of Mexico bowl with chicken instead of shrimp. Everything was fresh and great quality, but overall kind of bland. The avocado dressing just tasted like a pureed avocado, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for a flavor punch that dressing will not suffice. If you get chicken, it's ground meat instead of chopped--just FYI in case you don't realize it when you order. I think the ground chicken definitely makes the bowl look more like that classic clean ""meal prep"" lunch. I'm sure there are other bowls with dressings that are far more tasty. I mean, they even have a healthy mac and cheese. But when I come here it's either the intention to go all the way and eat as many greens as possible. 

As others have said, Grabbagreen is a great option if you're really trying to stick to a healthy eating habit.

Overall: Great value. You're not spending much, but you also aren't getting much either. The place is exactly what they advertise. We'd stay here again.",2010-03-27 19:38:09,-0.20930885,0.5265139,-0.7363977

The place feels cool inside in term of temperature because it is build slightly below the ground level. And the food is perfect for winter time, because it will make you sweat!

The food is amazing here if you order their soft tofu. It comes with the tofu soup, rice and side dishes, which are amazing. (Don't be shy to ask for more if you want more kimchi, cucumber or bean spout).  I've tried pretty much all the different soft tofu on the menu. I recommend ordering soft tofu and nothing else, because on the flip side menu, there is not much to order. The food is just ok and quite pricey. If I have to recommend, I would say the bibimbap in hot stone pot.  Everything else is not really worth it, although I have friends who really dig the BBQ squid.

Oh... the Food Truck a staple in some cities a midnight dream walking from the taverns, pubs, and cocktail bars alike everyone loves the smells and enticements of a great Food Truck. I have heard rumors that West Coast Taco was one of these great food trucks ""Best tacos in town!"" they would say. I find the best way to test the theory of the quality of the Food Truck is to do so sober. The drunken palate cannot be trusted. So, I found myself walking across from the Indianapolis Capitol building and there it was a tall black truck with a group of people waiting around it. I thought to myself this is a good sign a line is always good. There where people suited up, people in shorts and jeans a nice group. I look to the menu and ask the young lady for the burrito with pork and a taco of course. I waited for my reasonably priced meal that was handed to me in a reasonable time. I walked a bit found a nice shady bench and took a bite. Expectations set high and was let down. This wasn't the greatest taco not even close the burrito included. The rice seemed over cooked and nothing special the meat was fine but again nothing to write home about but enough to warn you about.  If you are drunk, bombed, smashed, or even a bit tipsy these maybe the tacos for you but they are not for me. Food trucks these days are seen as restaurants on wheels gourmet pirates that travel the asphalts of our cities serving its citizens delicious goodness of whatever niche they are driving at. There are a number of Food Trucks in Indianapolis now I have been to three of them and tasted what they have told me was their signature grub and have been disappointed. Food Trucks are coming to Indianapolis and I have high expectations, every time you hear of these Food Trucks they are suppose to be the best ever and I am waiting for the best to come to Indy because they are not here yet.",2013-01-07 20:50:08,-3.8506885e-05,-0.25418893,-0.35500216

They are definitely a no nonsense kinda place.  We were told, ""Menu's on the table, head up to the bar when you are ready to order.""

We ended up sharing a medium (12-inch?) Chicago style with peps and mushrooms and I pretty much fell out of the booth when I saw the cheese oozing out - this was my kind of pizza!  Now if you are all about the sauce and toppings I would not recommend this because the bread and cheese are the obvious standouts.  I was a little worried that with all the cheese the crust would be soggy but it was awesomely crisp on the bottom and probably sturdy enough to pick up had I wanted to.  The sauce was deliciously spicy and we guessed might have had sun dried toms in it to give it the deeper hue?  After one slice I was full, after another half slice I was woozy, this pizza is no joke!

The service menu is a little confusing - I take that back - it is very confusing! You will understand why at the end. Ok, so I said, how about a 20 minute foot massage and a mini-facial. I sign the log book and give them my cell phone number. They will call me when a ""slot"" opens. Waited about 15 minutes in one of their empty recliner/massage chairs. Actually very nice. A gentlemen comes over and turns on the recliner massager and starts massaging my feet. Actually very nice. Another gentlemen comes over and starts to place some soothing pads on my face and asks ""Do you want the collagen eye pads?"" - I said, ""OK, sure"". Thinking that he was asking if it was ok to place pads on my eyes. There are soothing pads on my face and eyes. He then massages my face (on top of the pads) and neck and arms and upper shoulders. He then removes the pads. I was in the chair a total of 30 minutes for the foot massage and mini-facial. I was actually relaxed and it was nice. Now here comes the ""problem"". The gentleman that did my facial tallies up the bill. $40 for a 20-minute foot massage. $40 for a Collagen Full Face Mask AND another $30 for Collagen Eye Mask. Hmmmmm $110 for 30 minutes. I was prepared to pay $70 plus tip - I was not prepared to pay $110 plus tip. This spa is a very nice concept and I will use it again. But please be careful about the prices and services. Ask about detailed pricing before the services are performed. I am giving 2 stars because the facial gentlemen clearly knew that he was misleading me with that $30 collagen eye add-on.

The menu is pretty solid - there's something for anybody on there, provided they like Asian-Fusion cooking. It's a cheaper way to get a lot of the same dishes you can find at PF Chang's, which is nice. Everything I've tried here has been decent, but I do have a few complaints.

First is the rice. They just go crazy with the rice and there's way too much on the plate. They use it as a filler to make you think you're getting a large portion of food while they skimp on the meat & veggies. Now, if you love rice, I guess you *are* getting a large portion of food - but I don't, and I only eat the parts of the rice that get the sauce on them or mix in with the real food. So I end up with 3+ cups of uneaten rice on my plate when I leave, and I hate wasting food. I really wish they would offer a substitute for the rice (I don't even mind paying an extra $0.99 or whatever), so that I could get more veggies instead of the rice. If you ask for no rice, they just leave it off the plate but don't give you an option for substitution.

Second is the way their nutrition info is listed on their website. Everything on the nutrition info is at least half the serving you actually get in the restaurant and excludes the massive portion of rice, which is a practice that I feel is deceptive. Now, obviously it's labelled that it's two servings, but realistically if you're not eating the 3+ cups of rice on your plate, the actual food is only enough for one person's meal.

I don't expect it to be healthy food, not by a long shot - after all, it's essentially dressed-up fast food and is mostly deep-fried and covered with sugar. But the least they could do is list it honestly and simply in their nutrition info rather than trying to make their restaurant look like a healthy option that it isn't. (This is the same type of annoyance that comes from seeing ""individually packaged"" treats with 2, 3 or more servings per container. It's just annoying.) Some of the soups listed on their nutrition info are 4 servings per bowl.

Third, it's fairly generic Chinese takeout type food. Sure, they put a little twist on it and have nice presentation and marketing, but at the core it's just your typical Americanized Chinese takeout. Mongolian beef, their version of General Tso's, their version of Sesame chicken... and often their version is less tasty than that of the (cheaper) takeout places. 

Dollar for dollar, you'll get a lot more for your money at a regular takeout place.  Jin Cheng's in Mt. Laurel is pretty good and for the price of one meal at Pei Wei, you can get 3+ days of meals, and it tastes better too.

That said, Pei Wei is an acceptable option - just not a place I absolutely love.",2012-08-23 19:52:47,0.43447676,0.33272603,-0.06692874

First off, please don't see any of my complaints as reflecting poorly on the staff, all of which did a great job and deserve whatever employment they have. Most of the issues I had were beyond the staff's control and probably due to my own lack of research before I booked my room. That said...

There wasn't any bathtub, pool, sauna, spa etc, I realize this place is less expensive than the Ritz or other nearby hotels and I didn't realize until midway through the stay how much this would affect my stay. Room service closes at 10 or 11pm, which was a disappointment, and a small room service menu. Considering the prices for breakfast items, it wasn't very impressive and nothing seemed made to order. WiFi is very unreliable, I had a corner room and never had a consistent connection for more than a few minutes at a time. The guest computers in the lobby didn't have any kind of ""user profile"" system so be aware and erase temporary internet files if you use them - when I got on the computer the previous guest's Gmail info was all right there for me to get into if I wanted. 

The decor looks flashy but once you poke around you realize it's all pretty cheap stuff, the dresser drawers in my room didn't close all the way, towels were scratchy and thin, carpet was old and funky etc. Also the valet charges in the neighborhood of $35 for parking, there is a 24hr parking lot with tons of space literally 100 feet away that charges about $23. Breakfast buffet is around $20 for the same cheapo continental that you would get at say a Best Western. At one point the fire alarm went off because a drunk guest went out the fire door to throw up, everyone evacuating saw this happen as they went down the stairs, but we still had to leave even though it was confirmed there was no actual fire.

I would rather spend more money next time and stay somewhere with better amenities. If you want to stay somewhere cheap, stay somewhere that's actually cheap - this place was around $135 a night even with the Friends and Family discount. There are places for $70 per night that offer similar amenities.",2016-06-22 22:56:01,-1.5848918,-0.2182935,-0.67522776

Based on Yelp reviews, I originally wanted to try a Mexican place on Milpas. There were a few places but no parking, police activity, and mostly tourists.  Yes, that's what I said.  In my experience, being from l.a., whenever tourists are involved, quality goes down, especially in family run Mexican food!  I don't go near the chains!

Anyway, after being bothered about the parking and avoiding the crowds of State St., I stumbled upon Taqueria Cuernavaca.  Tacos al pastor are my fave so getting 3 was a no brainer.   Yum yum yum!   A squirt of lime, some onion and cilantro.  Delicioso!  Not greasy at all and love the pineapple on top!   The salsa selection was decent. The two green salsas seemed too spicy, and the pico de gallo seemed to have no spice, besides tomato.  Oh well.  I'm here for a few more days, I might hit this place up again.

Came here for brunch at noon on a Saturday.  There was a good crowd but we were seated immediately.
 
We were handed a brunch menu w/ 7-8 different things, mainly standard breakfast offerings under $10. I opted for the huevos rancheros and my friend got the meat frittata.
 
The huevos rancheros came out and looked amazing! (see pic)  It was more like a giant mexican breakfast pizza with a super thin crust.   It had eggs n salsa n cheese n black beans n some sort of cream (creme fraiche?).  And it tasted as amazing as it looked!  This thing was delicious and I will defintiely be back for it.
 
Unfortunately the meat frittata was a disappointment.  It was basically a flavorless disc of egg.  Compared to the amazing flavor in the huevos rancheros, this fell short. A side of salsa helped somewhat. It came with potatoes, which were also meh.  At least the accompanying biscuit was good.
 
I ordered a biscuit for a buck extra.  It came with a side of strawberry preserves that were excellent.  A buck well spent.
 
3.5 stars, but I'll bump it to 4 because of the good service, no wait time, and overall nice atmosphere.

The fish is awesome because it's lightly fried, not too much. I also loved the pickled jalapenos on them. Korean BBQ was great and I'd just say the Local BBQ was okay...had a little too much sauce for me.

DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO RISK IT!!!!!

I will try to explain just how bad the customer service is at Peppermill Reno. I have never been treated so terribly at a hotel before. I booked a Grand Spa Suite a few days before my stay for two nights. I had booked it online, but before I did I had called to confirm that I would get one of the remodeled rooms and non-smoking, and was told that the front desk was very good at accommodating me. Great, but not so fast. When I get there is when I get the slapped in the face by their hotel staff. Upon check in, the little fucktard does the whole typing on his computer really fast and you could tell he's up to no good. I was nervous I was about to get bad news, and I was right. He proceeds to bullshit me about how they don't have my requested room anymore and that he would offer me a $50 ""discount"" and put me in a much downgraded room. Nothing close to what I reserved and paid for. Not even a non-remodeled room, not even one that was a smoking room of what I reserved. The way he put it was like he was doing me a favor or something. And he just stood there and said that's all he could do. No apology, nothing. They apparently don't care that they overbook and screw their customers over. I wasn't about to put up with that. I asked for a manager and got one named Russell Powers. I tell him how I felt and rudely interrupts me and tells me what he can do for me. Ok, fine, tell me what you got. I was trying to tell him that if they couldn't give me the room I requested then they ought to give me an upgrade. He tells me that he can't the first night but the second night he could give me an upgrade.  I have no choice but to accept. You get it? They know you have no choice but to accept so therefore they think they can overbook all they want and then push a downgraded room to everyone at a ""discounted rate"". Well I'm going to tell everyone I can on the WORLD WIDE FUCKING WEB just how shitty Peppermill's customer service is. I will never stay there again, and I wouldn't advise anyone else to.  How's that for retaliation Peppermill? Eh? Is it worth it screw me over? I'm going to be doing everything in my power to steer people away from staying at your hotel. This is not the 80's anymore!

It isn't where you go to/order from expecting some processed, plain old boring, food. You have to be willing to try something new to enjoy the place (assuming you don't already eat artisan food).

Their hummus is really inconsistent, but it's good. I think it comes with olives on it, but you don't need them. You can also ask to have the pita toasted lightly or not at all. They're chips after being toasted. I prefer the soft, fluffy, moist pita.

The salads aren't too big or too small, depending upon how much you eat.

For delivery; if your food comes late, 9 times out of 10, it isn't the delivery driver's fault. There's only one slow driver there. The rest know the area VERY well and are very fast and efficient.

ALSO! THESE DELIVERY DRIVERS DO NOT HAVE THEIR GAS PAYED FOR BY THE RESTAURANT! They get paid minimum wage and that's it. ""No delivery charge"" doesn't mean ""Don't tip."" They truly depend on those tips, help them out if you think they're polite and deserve it.

They'll usually call you to let you know they're outside or near your house, which is nice because you don't have to sit by the door.

I like this place because you can get creative with your pizzas and the cooks will comply! They enjoy the challenge, I think. There's a lot of options and you can customize however you want! I heard that once they made a pizza sandwich? Like a customer requested two pizzas put together like a sandwich. Sounds awesome to me, haha.

I recommend Reginelli's, for sure. You can either have the food delivered in a timely manor, fresh out of a nice hot pizza bag with nice cold drinks on top. Or you can dine in and sit outside and people watch on your laptop with your dog. I've never sat inside.

We were a little apprehensive about trying a brand new place but went for it anyway, and we are truly glad we did.

Making the most of our night out, we tried something from nearly every part of the menu. Starting with signature drinks, my wife (on whose account I am writing this now) ordered the Dark and Stormy and I ordered a gin cocktail, the Martinez. The Martinez was strong and excellent. Perfectly balanced in my opinion and kept getting better with every sip. My wife liked her drink as well, but in my mind, mine was the star.

We ordered two appetizers, the jumbo prawn cocktail and the Seared Scallop Coquille Taverna. I had heard that everything at the restaurant arrived fresh, not frozen, and I believe it---the prawns were big and succulent. I normally eat shrimp cocktail for the sauce but found myself enjoying the prawns, prying into the tails to get every last piece. Then came the scallops...well, give me a second. I could have stopped right there. THEY WERE PHENOMENAL. Absolutely the best part of the meal. Big and creamy, the bacon a perfect contrast, adding saltiness, and the leek cream sauce on which they rested...perfect. I believe we will order this every time we go back.

Obviously I could go on...and on, but I will try and keep this from being too long. My wife ordered the Italian Gnocchi, which she liked very much, the Napoleta sauce was fresh and the sweetness of the tomatoes really shined. I ordered the Bleu Filet Mignon which melted in my mouth, no steak knife needed (though one, of course, was provided.) The Maytag bleu cheese, bacon, and wild mushroom red wine butter sauce complimented the filet perfectly. Sides of the market vegetables and truffle fries were wonderful additions, especially as the fries had bits of actual truffle on them.

The Chef recommended a lovely wine that was also offered to us by our server, which paired nicely with both of our dishes, and as a bonus, wasn't terribly expensive (Eruption, I believe it was called, though I don't think it was part of the regular wine inventory).

Dessert included a flight of creme brulees: caramel, chocolate and espresso, and after-dinner signature drinks: the Hot Pumpkin (an adult version of the Pumpkin Spiced Latte) and the Alexander (gin, cream and Godiva liquor). All were terrific, though in my case the gin drink didn't quite compliment the dessert. My fault, next time I will get one or the other, I think (though it will be hard to decide which one I liked more), or get a recommendation on a better pairing.

Not to leave anyone out the service was excellent. The front of house staff seemed genuinely excited about the new restaurant and between our server, the bartender, and even those not waiting on us, our night was quite lovely.

I find myself feeling mixed emotions as I end this review. On the one hand, I don't want to spread the word about Taverna--I want it to be a place that only my wife and I know about, taking our friends, sure, but keeping it a secret. On the other hand, the hard work and accomplishments of the head chef, mixologist, cooks, service staff and owners should be rewarded with lots, and lots, and lots, of business.",2013-10-28 03:25:04,-0.113627456,-0.18631071,0.0074639027

Nobody really talks much about the enormous amount of flavored bottled sodas you can try (we tried a Green River lime soda and a Reed's spiced apple soda - fantastic). Lots of mention about the shakes, but not much was said about the homemade ice cream desserts that they have. I was expecting the typical burger bar and got so much more!

The atmosphere is super cool. Two stories, with the longest communal table you ever will see and a bar. Upstairs has traditional seating that overlooks downstairs and also has bar-type seating around the perimeter of the windows. The kitchen is exposed on the first level, separated from the dining room with various gigantic window panes.

We started with the smoked onion rings - some of the best I've ever had - with Rooster sauce (awesome mix of stone grain mustard and mayo). For dinner, I went with one of the ""burger war"" beef burgers - espresso rubbed, topped with blue cheese, caramelized onions, bacon, and apple slivers. It was awesome! The flavors totally worked and it was obvious the ingredients were all high quality. We split fries with their cheese sauce - fries were great and the cheese sauce was good, but not your typical - it was very light in color and had hints of white wine. Pretty good, but not as good as the Rooster sauce. For dessert, we split scoops of pistachio and salted caramel ice cream. We made it a sundae (chocolate, whipped cream, and nuts) for $2 more - the premium mixed nuts on top made the up charge more than worth it.

Service was top-notch. Very helpful, answered every question knowledgeably, was around enough but not too much.

The only complaint and the only thing from keeping this a 5-star review is the fact that they serve the burgers on cold buns. It got to the point where I started eating my burger with a fork to work around the bun. It looks like they bake them on site, so I'm not sure why they wouldn't take the extra step to toast them before they serve you.

All of those things bring a giddy feeling and smile to my face when I walk through those tall wooden doors.

There are so many good things about this place but as always I have to mention the cons... First and foremost be prepared to make it a field trip, especially on the weekends. The time spent there is worth the food but have a lot of time to throw out the window when you go. Also go on an empty bladder b/c I have found only one bathroom there to use and thats not enough for the crowds on the weekend. Third- the parking takes some patience at times but the attendants out there are always helpful. 

Even if you go there only just once its a great feeling to enjoy some good food under the shade of the trees surrounded by others with the same great taste. So go and enjoy yourselves :)",2014-04-22 15:30:36,0.316837,0.57914406,-0.3195174

We find the food to be very good. One favorite of ours is the chicken piccata. Some dishes are less exciting, but there is a reasonable mix and plenty of healthy options.

Service is generally friendly, and usually prompt enough, though I do note the infrequent glitch. A new manager at this location makes a point of trying to get around to personally see customers. The kitchen will modify dishes (I don't care for capers in the chicken piccata, for instance).

The dining room is nice enough, though I prefer those at other Italian chains.

I appreciated how they got so much Ube flavour into the soft serve because Ube naturally is starchy and subtle in flavour. The mangga (mango) flavour was great and tasted fresh, rich, fruity, and sweet (but not too sweet!). I loved how the soft serve wasnt overbearingly sweet, so I literally finished it in under 10 minutes because I couldn't stop eating, I loved it so much! Ube was my favorite by the way. One of my favorite parts was the marshmallow plug at the bottom which was really yummy and clever since it prevented the ice cream from dripping out of the bottom.

La Colombe, in a word, is fabulous. While their cappuccinos do not feature the perfect combination of espresso crema and milk froth to create glorious ""latte art,"" I still gulped a couple of these drinks down during my three random trips to Philadelphia. The espresso was not bitter and the milk was just rightly sweet. I couldn't complain. Their large mug of coffee is great too. 

Relax - coffee snobbery is not all THAT rampant here. The lack of a menu (which tells you that you are only allowed the classics - the way it should be done anyway, frankly) balances out with the OK espresso shots. However, if memory serves me right, the shop uses a La Marzocco to pull its shots (WAY snobby, but in the right way).

My favorite thing about La Colombe, though, is the atmosphere. Large windows are placed opposite a warm dark wood interior, which truly provides a world that is the best of both. People-watching is a definite do here. True characters haunt this place. One time when I went, a scrubby young man, who had just seemingly finished smoking his cigarette outside, came back in with the stub of his cigarette enclosed in his hand and jacket sleeve.

I love this place so I will be back to sample more.  I can't wait to test out the patatas bravas, tacos and other great things on their short but wonderful menu.

I'm in love with the Tiki bar in the rear of the restaurant.  Absolutely in love with it.  I heard that they plan to expand it, which makes me happy since the seating is very limited.  The drink menu at the back bar is a bit limited, but with the cute outdoor plants, cute cocktails, strings of lights, and bar, I could spend a whole afternoon and evening in the Tiki bar without any desire to leave.  Don't be nervous about trying to track the entrance to the Tiki bar down--it's worth asking for the directions to get back there.  

I won't stop going to this place when summer ends.  Atmosphere is one of the most important things about any place I go to and I love the care that the owners took in designing the interior of this place.

It's the newest and most expensive theatre around and yet their A / V equipment is unreliable. On more than one occasion, I've had the sound or projection cut out completely while watching a movie.  
On one such instance, I could not believe how poorly they handled it. I seriously felt like I was on Candid Camera.

it happened during the last 30 minutes of The Avengers. The sound cut out but the movie continued without it. The entire ending was about to be spoiled, so we left quickly to inform the staff, but there was already a manager waiting for us in the hallway. He told us ""Don't worry, we're going to rewind it for you so you don't have to miss the ending! Just go have a seat, we'll get it all fixed"".  
We were pleasantly relieved so we went back inside to have a seat. 5 minutes later, watching the silent film continuing to unfold before us, we started to realize we may have been lied to. We walked out again and told the manager (who was still waiting there) that it hadn't been rewound yet. He stammered a vague apology and said they were ""working on some technical difficulties"" but assured us that ""we will rewind it soon"".

I told him that it was too late, the ending was already spoiled, so we had no interest in going back to see it a second time. So he asks us to follow him for some freebie tickets for my next visit(which I didn't even want; I just wanted to see my movie that night. Babysitters aren't always easy to come by!)
This would've been almost acceptable, but here's the worst part: Two girls lined up for the same theatre we had just left. He told them ""hold tight, we'll be starting your movie soon!"" right in front of me! 
So I asked him, right in front of them, ""Which is it? Are you going to fix the broken speakers and rewind the ending? Or start the next movie without any sound? Your stories don't match up, so which one of us are you lying to?""  
  
He stammered another apology (and admitted that they were starting the next movie, NOT rewinding the first one). He then gave us popcorn coupons. Whooptie doo. I don't want to sound entitled, it's not like I demanded anything at all. I really couldn't care less if they didn't give us any coupons, but I found this insulting after we had been lied to so many times. I would've rather heard an explanation for why they thought it was acceptable to lie to us to get us back in our seats.

I just wish they'd be a bit more respectful and honest with their customers. Our date night was ruined and the management very obviously tried to placate us with whatever story they could come up with. And in the process, they spoiled the ending by convincing us to watch most of it silently under the false pretense that it would be fixed and rewound. If they had just told us the truth, we would've left and the ending would not have been ruined, and we would have had an earlier start for the remains of our evening.",2012-07-17 20:12:11,-1.7449964,-1.0774809,0.10790138

I found a plethora of listings, but many of them had a good amount of unhappy customers telling their hair-horror stories. I didn't want to join the ranks of the edgeless and balding so I began to drift from the idea of rocking glorious Senegalese twists this summer. It wasn't until I stumbled across Elegance African Hair Braiding on Facebook that hope was restored; restored in having decent braiders out there and acquiring my summer 'do.

The Facebook page was very active with many customers expressing their satisfaction, commenters touting the hairstyles and asking to prices for potential appointments on the pictures. The business owner replied back and constantly mentioned that customer satisfaction was always first. On the Google reviews, there was one customer who expressed dissatisfaction, but I was very happy to see the owner trying to rectify the situation.

I scheduled my appointment via phone and went in two days later. On the phone, I told Esther the style and length I wanted and she gave me a price of $200 (hair included). When I arrived, she did most of my hair. She was very nice and very professional. Another woman joined her (Aicha?) and she finished my hair. Neither women raked my thick, kinky hair with a fine tooth comb, like some shops.

I got waist-length medium-sizes Senegalese Twists, using Xpression brand hair. I am very satisfied. The twists aren't tight and I didn't experience any headaches or extreme discomfort. I will be a returning customers if I want braids next year.

That was it, no please feel free to grab a drink at the bar, have a seat while you wait, nothing. After about 10 mins waiting I made my way to the bar to order a glass of wine for me and my guest. The bartender walked by multiple times without acknowledging me or offering a menu, I took a menu from a guest next to me. When he finally come to take my order there was no hello, no how are you, no sentence at all. It was just a simple word.. Drink? No smile nothing at all to make me feel welcomed.

When we were finally sat, our server came by. Once again no smile, no hello, how are we tonight? Just her name and weather we wanted tap or bottle water. Through out the course of our meal, she was inattentive, in-personable, barely smiling or trying to interact with us. 

The biscuits they dropped at the beginning of our meal where the highlight of the evening, the butters perfect and the biscuits wonderfully fluffy and layered to perfection

We started with some snacks, pig ears came out overly salted, and room temp and chewy. As if they'd been sitting a minute. The conch fritters were good, well seasoned and the sauce added great balance.

We finished up and what I'm assuming was a service manager or floor manager came by with our second course... mind you we had not been cleared or re-silvered from our first course. Instead of turning around and clearing us before dropping food, he simply dropped the courses and walked away.. coming back after a few minutes to clear the dirty plates and drop new share plates. 

Our second courses were the gulf shrimp with Calabrian Chile's which were tasty, and a very good dish... the tuna tartar on the other hand was again extremely salty, maybe due to seasoning before considering that salty tobiko/caviar of some type was going on top which made the dish almost inedible. 

This time our plates were cleared and we did get re silvered. For our entrees we ordered the ""acclaimed"" curry goat and the red fish dish.

Neither dish wowed me. The fish was one dimensional, there was no textural contrast in the dish. The sauce, the fish, the garnish, was all soft, room temp, and this time extremely under seasoned. It was lacking some sort of acidity and crunch to wake it up. The goat was under seasoned as well and lacking depth. Though the gnocchi was very well cooked and made it was not enough to save the dish. The sad thing is, even though our distaste was apparent, the server made no inquire as to why we hadn't eaten our entrees. no manager came to check on us, it seemed as though the staff was just floating through their night. 

I expected a lot more from the service and food for a restaurant as widely acclaimed as this one is. Nothing about this evening screamed best new chef, James beard award nominee, or eater hot 38. This was appalling service from start to finish and the food to match. Definitely sucks when you're on vacation and this is your one special meal and you get the bill and are out 200 dollars after tip for something you wish never happened.

We ended up skipping dessert and going someplace else.

Edit* Extremely disappointed at the fact that I have yet to receive any response from the management. You would think that they would want to at least try to redeem them selves for this but alas... just floating through on the laurels",2018-03-16 17:31:22,-0.63044584,-0.61217386,-1.8550363

The restaurant is only half a block to my apartment, so I pass by it all the time and after trying it for the very first time when it first opened. I couldn't honestly call myself a fan. What can I say? I ordered the kebob and everybody who knows anything about Greek/Turkish food is that kebobs are the most generic thing on the menu and can't really reflect the skills of the chef. On top of that the restaurant is popular and the space is small with tables arranged very closed to each other and I'm a bit claustrophobic. At the end of the meal I freaked out  a little and had to run out of the restaurant to catch a breath. After that experience I was a bit afraid to go back. Then there was a pretty long and angry respond to a newspaper review that got pasted on the window of the kitchen, I'm sure I'm not the only one who got weirded out by it.

It wasn't until Food Network's The Best Thing I've Ever Ate that got me pay more attention to my Greek neighbor. I went back for the Cyprus breakfast promoted by the program and it was good, real good. Everything on the plate was done perfectly; Eggs are fried to a crispy edge with the center remains raw, bread is toasted to a crunchy goodness, lounza ham is salty and dry is a good way. and can I just scream how I love the Halloumi cheese especially when it's fried to a crispy outside and a melty inside? I can have that everyday and be content. 

A second visit to the same plate proves that it's better to visit on weekdays when there are less patrons and the cooks can pay more attention to the food. On weekends, the quality can suffer because of the rush. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the decor simple and homey. I think they took the kebob out of the menu and I remember the dip being stellar. They also seemed to have a cooking class held on weekends sometimes, check their glass window. Even off-putting at times, a grouchy Greek chef may signifies a chef of standards.

There's a great selection of wine here, and you'll most certainly find what you're looking for. The prices are great too. I believe you can find Crane Lake for $4.99 and there's a host of other cheap standbys at decent prices. If you're in the mood for something a little more posh, you'll still save money.

The liquor selection is one of the best in town, especially the whiskey. There are some unusual and hard to find bourbons (including ones recently featured in the show Three Sheets) and some expensive and hard to find Irish single malts and special editions.

So you pick your own cheese, then the staff just unwraps it, puts it on a try and serves it with some really thick slices of bread and a few small accouterments.  For the price of the cheese plate, I expect the cheese to be sliced, presented in a better way and that  bread needs to go!  It is way to thick and the pieces are way too big. The bread ends up being the highlight of the cheese tray. It would be better if you can bring your own cheese and then Bacchanal can provide other bread and items for purchase instead.

Ever since Novemeber when these nice people opened up a beacon of deliciousness up the street, I feel finally as though my world of comfort food in proximity is more complete.

Growing up in the Bronx, surrounded by killa Puetro Rican and Dominican cookin, a redheaded stepchild develops mad hankerings that really take hold. For instance, mine is a life-long love of every incarnation of plantain. I mean, crispy tostones, or soft cartelized maduros, mofongo- they're just the epitome of comfort food for me, however you wanna prepare em, gimmmeee. 

I repeat, there is some good Latin home cookin happening at between 6th & 7th on South. You're covered whether you want a lil snacky, or, light-to-no-coma-more-of-a-heavy-nap inducer of a platter. Whadda joy to stop real in real quick, to this cafeteria style restaurant, for empanadas, or a Cuban sandwich, or those rellenos de papa! More of those potato balls later. You babies get your own paragraph.

We skew porky pernil (so juicy, fatty, and crispy skinned- every kinda porky way) when it comes to platters but have also developed a real habit with the tasty beef stew, too. These meats and many more, served platter-style, come with choice of type of rice and beans, a little salad, and then some so delicious maduros. So good. Sweet plantains: creamy sweetness between salty bites. I wax poetic about plantains. That's what happens.

I'm such a fan of sides, though. That's where the ole gal gets herself into a real, ""Carb it up, carb face,"" situation, I'll call it. I could do me up a plate just like that. Like, all sides all day. If there was ever to be a national day dedicated to starchy carb feasts, I'd like to spend such a holiday here at Latin Flavor, cause all my favorites they gots.

Latin Flavor's yellow rice and peas- arroz con gandules-  that's the move. We order extra sides of black beans, because they are perfect. Yuca frita is really crispy-fluffy and just what you want. If I mention plantains one more time your eyeballs will scream, but you know? 

And then there are the potato balls. The rellenos de papa. Do you want a crispy softball sized orb of seasoned mashed potatoes with a beefy center? You should. Cause they're dope. They're also the best that I've had in YEARS. Super flavorful. As other wise reviewers have noted- get em with gravy. Doooo it. 

Now here's the one thing, certainly you can scurry on home with generous portions of Latin platters, stuffed into take-out tins, but I say to you, eat your rellenos de papas at the restaurant for optimum excellence. Of course they'll still be good to-go, but take some time outta your life to enjoy the crispy, crispy, crispy outter shell in contrast to the mash and gravy. That's peak potato ball time.

Right, so I command you: You sit there and eat your potato balls.

Alright, you see what's happening here. I'm loving this spot for lunch and dinner and snacks and everything. Long live Latin Flavor.",2015-03-09 04:59:58,-0.0007108405,0.34751898,0.52421504

So tonight we decided to try somewhere new in the Garden District of New Orleans, Louisiana for food and we stumbled upon this place after our first choice was closed down(Yelp hadn't updated their page, so thanks for that, Yelp!) which ended up being a blessing in disguise!

The restaurant itself is quite long and narrow with seating available on the left and the cashier/bar/cooking areas located down the right. Along the side of the bar are bar stools for those who wish to have easy access to drinks/the workers through out their meal. Being able to see the food being prepared right in front of you in a nice touch as if you're paranoid about food preparation, you'll see there are no nasty surprises awaiting you.

So we(yes, ""we"", I didn't eat all that food myself!) ended up ordering a cheese burger slider, fried chicken slider, and two others(I didn't eat those) along with a side of fries. The sliders were delicious. A nice crisp bun with well cooked beef(cheese burger) and chicken(fried chicken) with appropriate dressing made the sliders an excellent experience. The fries were also quite good, had a nice crunch to them, no complaints at all.

For dessert, we ordered a 7 Layer Donut and an Elvis Donut. The 7 Layer was fantastic. Now, the 7 Layers are actually 7 different toppings but I can't remember most. What I remember, there was caramel, pecan, and coconut.  It was really delicious! The Elvis Donut..I didn't think too much of this one. It had caramel, bacon, and bananas. Three things I enjoy but definitely not when put together.

Bottom line: this place is overpriced.  Case in point in the tomato and mozzarella appetizer.  It's $9.75.  I understand that appetizers and desserts are the place to mark-up prices, and that's fine. These people run a business to make money.  However, I cannot respect a restaurant that gouges its customers.  This particular appetizer is one tomato cut up (prob cost them 50 cents), a few small mozzarella balls, and then a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette.  A dish that costs them $2-$3 to make should not be priced at $9.75.  Similarly, a bottle of beer, Stella, cost $7.  Furthermore, the menu prices on their website are out of date and misleading.  Another case in point: the veal saltimbocca.  On the website, it's listed as $23.  In the restaurant, however, its $25.  This is one of my favorite dishes because of the prosciutto that is traditionally supposed to cover the veal cutlet.  At Ralph's, there were three tiny bites of prosciutto.  I honestly don't think I was even given one full slice, let alone enough to cover the veal.  

I think Ralph's offers traditional Italian food in a great atmosphere.  However, in a city like Philadelphia where Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen, Ralph's has to do much more to make it worth your while.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great either.  On top of serving lackluster food, they have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for it.  I can think of at least two other Italian restaurants in the city where the food is better AND cheaper.  Ralph's is the perfect example of a once-great restaurant that is now resting on its laurels and relying on name only.

They offer a great deal on your first wax if you're a new client. And you get a discount every time you refer a friend - awesome!
The prices are really reasonable - their package deals are even better.
They do an awesome job with the waxing (most of the time)
It's almost always possible to get a last minute or walk-in appointment - something that is practically unheard of in other salons I've been to.

Cons:
They're extremely pushy about selling additional products, future appointments, packages - EVERYTHING. And it starts the moment you walk in. I've experienced everything from being heavily pressured to schedule my next appointment immediately after I finished, to having a tech talk up several products during my appointment, and then grab them all and put them on the counter with the bill when I went to pay, as if I had already agreed to buy them. Very uncomfortable.

This is not the place to come if you're expecting a relaxing experience. They make no effort to hide the fact that they're basically just trying to get clients in and out as soon as possible. This means that if you're getting a brazilian, you'd better not be shy, because not only will you not get a towel to cover anything, but the tech will also expect you to ""prepare"" while she's in the room.

I'm sure this is true for every salon, but the quality of the techs varies a LOT here. They mostly seem inexperienced. I've had some really great ones, but one or two who were really awful as well. (The tech I had for my last appointment missed several spots and spent the entire time trash talking the rest of the staff. Awkward!) So if you get someone you like, be sure to remember her name for next time! (I'm really bad at that.)

- Very pretentious, you probably need to be a ""somebody"" to be welcomed here

Pros - absolutely gorgeous, detailed decor.   
       Favored the berry bar we had over the cake, glitter was a special touch

We had to keep the doors open to clear out the smell, only to discover an old man (guest from another room) hanging over the balcony watching me undress.  Again, my complaint went completely unanswered.

Anyway, came here on Saturday night.  Its a perfect spot - right on beach blvd in the fancy part of downtown st. pete.  We were originally sat outside, but the weather didn't look like it would cooperate, so they moved us in when a table opened (and let that be your first tip boys and girls, when you make a reservation - and I would strongly suggest making one - make sure you request inside seating if its the rainy season).  

They don't have a huge menu, so we split 4 small plates.  Girlfriend got something, I got angus beef and bacon sliders, and we split a spinach and artichoke dip and lobster rolls.  Lets get past the sliders quickly - you'll want to eat 50 of them.  The lobster rolls were good, but I was expecting a hot item, and they were cold like thai basil rolls.  My fault for not being more careful when I ordered, but they were still good.  As for the spinach dip...I worked at a Houston's Restaurant for 4 years and continued to eat there for as long as there was one in the vicinity I lived in.  The Houston's spinach dip to me is the end all and be all of spinach dips and nothing has ever come close - until now.  This spinach dip was fantastic.  It may not have been the best, but it was so darn close.

The décor is beautiful.  Very romantic - my girlfriend called it like a French boudoir, and that's as good a description as any I could come up with.  And while it is romantic on the inside, it isn't very romantic as in it is not intimate.  The tables are set up for large parties, and though they can be separated for smaller parties, you're still going to be right on top of the one next to you.  We were at a small 2 top, and we were right in the open with everyone able to stare at us (and they're always staring, and their eyes say, why in the world is that beautiful woman with you).  The seating is also very limited inside, which again, is why a reservation is recommended.  Outside seating would work well provided it isn't the dead of summer and about to pour.

I should also point out that our server, Parker (no relation to Peter) was fantastic. He asked us if we wanted drinks, and after we said no, we checked in on yelp and saw we could get a free drink.  So, of course, we got a free drink.  We also told him we had the certificate from living social or groupon, and rather than treat us like a couple of cheapskates, he was terrific.  Never missed a beat, food came out timely, water stayed filled, and I hope our tip reflected it.  Perhaps he just realized if we checked in on Yelp, we were likely to review on yelp, or maybe he was just really good as his job.


So thank you Spiderman...I mean Parker.  And Tryst.  We'll definitely be back (for more sliders).",2013-09-09 20:17:57,-0.46740034,0.70511395,-0.8874249

It was mildly busy at this time.  Me and my party of three were seated with no wait.  But that was the last time I did not wait for the evening.  I really wanted to like this place.  I live in the neighborhood and want to shop local when possible.  But server, ""Tiger,"" kept willfully walking by table with no service over the course of 2 hours.  I've waited tables.  It is not easy.  Things happen, maybe she had a double section, maybe she was ill, I don't know.  But there was zero attempt at making right from the continued comedy of errors Sunday night.  The appetizer -- tater tots and cheese -- took 30 mins to come out!  The entrees - and we are talking cheeseburgers - ANOTHER 30 mins.  My table, where Tiger initially sat us, would be abandoned for 15-20 mins at a time -- except that she (the server) was walking by us over and again.  Was this absurdist theater?  Did we exist?  I thought she might try to smooth it over once she finally, and I mean after I BEGGED HER, to bring us the tab.  Nope, no hint of ""sorry.""

The lounge has a whole bunch of huge, full sized trees with white leaves sprouting up all over the place.. very cool. Even the chairs at the bar are super soft.

One note: poolside is really only conducive to couples, maybe a group of 4, not so much for groups. There are also plenty of other couches around for crowds.

While we tried to squeeze into the spot, a gentleman asked us if we'd like to have a seat at the ""back bar"" and I didn't even know there was such a thing!

And I hardly ever say that because honestly, usually when people take me to ""really delicious"" pizza places, it all tastes just about the same to me. The pizza is usually pretty good, but almost never is it so special that I would return to some place just for their pizza. I've felt that way about every pizza place I've tried in New Orleans so far, including (but not limited to) Angora, Slice, Domenica and Midway Pizza. I think the only place that has really captured my attention enough to be truly memorable - and this is a common sentiment - is Pizza Delicious, because they have those heavenly little garlic knots and pizza pocket calzone delights. 

Anyways, that said, I went to visit my friend who works on Oak Street and he wasn't quite off work yet so I popped by Mellow Mushroom to grab a couple slices because I was intrigued by the name. I like mellow; I like mushrooms. I fully intended on getting two slices but when I saw the HOLY SHIITAKE PIE, my attention was even more fully piqued. 

Garlic aioli? Check.
Olive oil and garlic base?? Check.
Caramelized onions??? Check. 
Shiitake, button AND portobello mushrooms???? Check.
Black truffle oil????? CHECK, DUDE, CHECK.

I don't really think I need to write the rest but obviously I ate an ungodly amount of that pizza and it was utterly delicious. I don't regret any of those calories, not a one. I almost got a beer but elected not to because I wanted to stuff as much pizza down my throat as humanly possible (highly recommend this strategy), looks like they have a pretty decent selection of on-trend craft beers though. I think it's really rad that they offer a pizza with garlic aioli, caramelized onions and black truffle oil. Appeals to those of us who are tired of the ""combo"" and the ""pepperoni"" and the ""margherita"". Once I hear the words ""black truffle oil"", I'm a goner.

So fear not, you uptowners, no need to drive down to the Bywater anymore to get a decent pizza fix. Just bike up to Oak Street. Also, the art is really cool and is all done by local New Orleans artists. + points.",2013-04-16 06:12:22,-0.14932127,0.3680225,-0.25528902

Took the dress in, tried it on so they could measure. Asked if they'd be able to match the color fairly well since my hair would be up. Was assured this was not a problem. Paid the $35.

Received a call a week later that the dress was ready. Went in, tried the dress on. The 3/4 of an inch addition was three inches, so now the strapless top is falling off. Not to mention the addition is silver/gray not anything close to my dress.

Walk out holding dress up, she seems oddly confused why it's too big. Remeasures and says oh you only needed it to be just under an inch.. Huh, weird I think I said that when I came and and you'd think you would have figured that out when measuring? Take dress off take back to counter, and ask about the color of the alteration. Told oh, we will look at that.

Calls the next day, I go in try on dress. Still doesn't fit right, still silver. Walk up to counter get my dress bag and when I make a comment, I'm told oh well we can fix it again. No, really I don't want you to fix it again. The work looks like a kid did it, the material is STILL silver/gray, it's still too big. I'll take it home and handle it myself and consider the $35 a lesson learned. 

I figure the second star was for at least attempting to fix something. But, seriously when asked if the color could be matched do not tell a paying customer yes, then not even make an attempt or bother to call to say you can't do it and allow the customer to make the decision. When the customer then comments about it when you have to fix a 2"" error, perhaps don't say it will be looked if you are not going to bother.

Santa Barbara Eats: Tony Ray's 


Since my friend began managing downtown's newest mexican restaurant, he hasn't quit calling me to come in. 
Being the good friend that I am (or at least think I am), I decided to give into his hype.
Tony Ray's, tucked away behind the State Street clamor, took me nearly twenty minutes to find, but in the end was worth the hassle.
My friend and I chose to sit outside on this overcast Tuesday afternoon, mostly because the dribbling water of the patio's fountain - complete with plastic roses and hibiscus buoyed among its three tiers - was almost therapeutic. 
The restaurant's menu serves up your every day Mexican food, stuff you can find at just about every other taqueria or cantina in California. And like most other Mexican restaurants reaching out to their American counterpart, you find your burgers, steaks and chicken tenders served alongside fried papas. 
Munching on my chicken burrito, but more so picking at my friends steak fajitas, I recognized that there's a lot to appreciate from this hole in the wall.
No. 1: the patio seating hosts a great view of the Riviera and De La Guerra Plaza; a popular hangout for Santa Barbara's homeless, but I digress.
No. 2: The place is kind of a secret. With no front entrance to State Street, you'd never imagine a restaurant ever existed here. 
No. 3: This sit down lunch, complete with ice tea and more chips and salsa than you can handle, came to about $20. Nothing on this menu costs more than $10, except for the filet mignon, $24.
Tony Ray's also holds karaoke night on Wednesday and Thursday nights.
Hosting a full bar that's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, the hole in the wall tries, and is worth giving a try. So if and when you go in, ask for Rony. Tell him I sent you.",2011-05-27 23:48:01,-0.94422185,-0.19425355,-0.37626028

La-Z-Boy leather seats that electrically recline, reserved seating, and food/beverage service? Score! Brilliant concept and let me tell you -- the seats were super comfortable. Thank goodness these recliners are big enough so that you are not rubbing elbows with the stranger sitting next to you. 

The food was ok but nothing spectacular. Menu offered appetizers, salads, entrees, homemade meatballs, pizza and desserts.

We started off with chilled Asparagus soup with Parmesan and prosciutto bits. I loved the velvety texture with the smokey flavor of the prosciutto, Very good, especially since I love asparagus . 

The next item was the gem salad, breakfast radishes/Nueske smoked apple-wood bacon/Maytag blue farm egg/baby loom tomatoes served with buttermilk dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh, another good item. 

The on to Ricotta gnocchi, I don't think  I've had Ricotta gnocchi before and I really like the lightness of this gnocchi. Of course they were served with a San Mazanos tomato sauce, you can never go wrong with San Marzaons tomatoes.

Next was the main entree, my friend had the Maine lobster pot pie deconstructed and I had the sterling silver flat iron steak with goat cheese rangoon. Neither one of us liked the lobster pot pie but that could be because we don't like lobster, we did try it though. The steak with the Edamame pesto and the rangoons were delicious I loved the Asian flare.

The location is a bit out of the way so I was hoping the food was good enough to make it a destination. The outside is inviting and the decor is fun and invites conversation.  However the mark of restaurant is the food not the decor. 

The chips and salsa were delicious. The chips were obviously fresh and not greasy. The salsa isn't chunky but is full of flavor. It didn't need heat to build it's profile. The queso was a bit difficult to enjoy but definitely spot on

Both my dining companion and myself chose the taquitos. I opted for the potato and chorizo while she went with chicken. I will admit the portions are a bit small but all in all they were tasty. 

To address other concerns, the menu is small but that is so the staff can concentrate on a new opening. Apparently the menu will be expanding. The servers were extremely friendly and attentive. 

Only criticism....while the blood orange margarita was delicious, the portion was way too small for the price.

Everything was top-notch: service, décor and the mouth-wateringly fantastic food. 

The menu was vegetarian friendly, too.  All is farm-fresh and made with great care.  The price was reasonable, especially considering the high quality. 

We each had their blueberry mixed green salad topped with goat cheese crumbles and almonds, dressed with blueberry vinaigrette. It was light and tasty and accompanied by a basket of warm  bread in three varieties.  

We shared the soup of the day, a root vegetable concoction that was super-tasty.  

For an entrée, we shared a starter (plenty of food for us two) of a thai curry with fresh vegies and tempeh with a light coconut milk sauce.  I had to restrain myself to keep from licking the plate. 

It's rare that we have room for dessert, but we made a point of ensuring we did to be able to enjoy the fresh blackberry pie tart.  With a small side of vanilla ice cream, it was a perfect ending to an outstanding meal.

CONS: Not too many outlets for laptop use (not a HUGE deal, but there have been a few times I've come with business to do and had to leave), the method they use to brew coffee can leave some hefty silt that makes coffee thick and sometimes bitter (we're splitting hairs now -- just get the Americano instead, it's great), there have been a few times my food has taken a while, so it's good to set yourself (and others) up for success by not being in a rush.

* high Brussels sprouts, these were so delicious! They roast them and crammed in crazy flavor. Turned around a life long hatred of the ""gross"" tiny  cabbages.  I wish I could have a bucket!
* high whipped feta. I took one bite and immediately went to Pinterest to find a recipe. Honestly though I don't think I'll be able to find one quite like it. It had amazing texture, smooth and light. Taste struck a great balance of salty feta and sweet honey. 
* high gnocchi. Whoa it's a bowl of tasty little pillows. I wanted to jump into the bowl!  The egg created created a great sauce for this dish. Highly recommended for your main course.

It wasn't crowded and we were sat right away. Immediately, our server, Kayla, stopped by the table and got our drink orders. 

We had Fried Mushrooms for our appetizers which come with a homemade ranch dipping sauce. These are easily the best fried mushrooms I have ever had in my entire life. The breading was crispy and the mushrooms inside were cooked all the way through, and were incredibly juicy. I don't know what they put in that batter, but holy cow. It was perfect. 

For dinner, we had a deep dish Daley Supreme, which has Mushrooms, sausage, onions and peppers. It was amazing. It was so filling, neither of us could have more than one slice, but the leftovers made for a great breakfast the next morning. 

The sauce is out of this world, so much so that I am kind of surprised at some of the reviews that have been critical of the sauce. It has the consistency of tomato paste but a very rich flavor that really ties the whole pie together. I have been to Chicago plenty of times and have a number of Chicago deep dish pizzas, and this pizza was FAR better than anything I ever had up there. Giordanos aint got nothin' on 312!

On top of the outstanding dinner, we had spectacular service. The server was on top of it, making sure our water glasses were always full and that our next beers were always ready when our glasses were empty. 

We will definitely be going back.",2014-10-12 18:16:00,0.7574706,-0.9196324,-0.16845246

I gave them my car for a wash and they returned it with a big head to toe crack on the windshield. They did everything to wiggle out of it and claimed that this was due to the heating and cooling since it was hot outside and they used cold water. They claimed (Todd, manager) it could have been a pre existing crack so I asked if they had video footage of the before image in which case just zoom in and you will see that the windshield was perfect when I gave the vehicle. At this point Todd, the manager said that their video was not that good and could not zoom in. Todd/manger also said that they have nothing at the car wash that could cause the crack. I pad $1000 to replace the windshield of my new CLS 550 Mercedez Benz and with the benefit of a doubt I switched to a different Waterway location in Kirkwood from Creve Coer. All this was because I was a car club member.

Around March or so this year, I started taking my Range Rover for a wash at the Kirkwood location. After , a few washes I started noticing hair line scratches on the body of the car. I inquired about this and again Todd, the manger told me that they have nothing at the wash that would cause this. This was my first black car and black shows a bit more so with a grain of salt I kept going to the wash but was more observant. During the next few months and I kept getting more and more scratches and each time the manager, Todd/Shawn or Nate would assure me that it has nothing to do with the wash and that there is nothing there that would cause this. Now consider that, out of the 24 or so washes over a 6 month period, I took the vehicle back 4 times for a re wash - on three occasions, I had armor all o the body of the car and once on the leather and interior of the vehicle. Well it occurred to me that possibly using the same cloth for tires and amoral for cleaning the body of the vehicle could easily cause scratches and therefore it would be a  blatant lie to say that there is nothing at Waterway that can cause scratches/hairline scratches on my vehicle. Besides, if any vehicle is washed right after a a very dirty one, it is very possible that dirt would remain on the cloth and easily scratch the next vehicle.

All these are possibilities to the hairline scratches however it is the mentality of the ownership and the mangers here that i have an issue with. The young employes just work and work hard and maybe sometimes make mistakes however management and the ownership have a very disturbing approach to customer issues. The process is simple. They will offer to erase the evidence and please don't mistake this with fixing the issue. When I pushed them to fix the scratches they told me that the burden of proof was on me and there lawyers would win - The came from Todd, the manager. As an alternative, they offered to do a cheap buff but I refused as a matter of principle and  given their bullish demeanor. It is not possible to take before and after pictures of your vehicle each time besides as a customer you would like to trust that the food placed in front of you is properly made. The idea of having the burden of proof is just wrong and ill conceived. When you have an issue with your vehicle at Waterway, they will quickly try to wipe it out, make it mild and have a way with words to get you to leave and or suggest that you are holding up other customers. Wiping evidence of incompetence and damages is part of the training here by the mangers.

I did insist that they pay for the damages.  The Range Rover has 6000 miles and lots of scratches on it. I threatened to take legal action and they refused and stated that the burden of proof is on me. Soon after I received a threatening letter from their lawyer stating that my membership had been discontinued and that i would be considered a trespasser at Waterway if I ever came back. The letter does not state any reason or wrong doing on my part which is the case. I will post on reddit as soon as I scan it.",2013-12-11 22:58:09,-1.8676424,-1.0315998,0.0023451762

Really good beer with some quality food.  I'm always out to try some IPA so obviously I went with an IPA flight at Depot.  The double was very smooth and the west coast was a nice rendition.  The other two were a pass in my opinion.  50% was a good start so I had to try some of their other big hitters.  The barleywine was terrific and boozy.  The barrel-aged scotch ale was ok but I'd order the barleywine if you're looking for an unusual boozy option.  

Coming during Happy Hour is the way to go.  $2 off liquor and many appetizers at affordable prices.  Poutine fries (of course when drinking beer) and some brussel sprouts.  The shishito peppers didn't have much going on but were pretty cheap and came with a dozen or so.  Many people ordered the kale dip with hummus as well as the fries sans poutine, either regular or sweet potato.  

I'd say come here during Happy Hour.  Grab some munchies, good beer, and watch some sports.  They have a very nice indoor area with 3 viewable TVs.  They also have an outdoor area with seats and some cornhole when the temperatures right.  Overall, a pretty nice beer bar with quality eats.",2017-07-11 04:46:53,0.10877998,-0.11917768,0.043946017

Once I took a friend and we sat outside and chatted for over half an hour and I finally couldn't stand it - I asked the people behind the counter about the order and it had been forgotten.  The sad thing was I assumed they were ""still making it"" due to my previous experiences.

I never even considered eating at the new one until recently.  I figured it had been quite some time and perhaps things had changed.  The entire experience was amazing - except the wait for the food.  The girl at the counter couldn't have been friendlier, the menu was great, my chai tea was as good as it gets, I loved the new decor.

It's delicious.

This chicken was perfectly cooked.  It was, as the back of their menu specified, zesty, crispy and juicy.  They have a chimichurri and another sauce called Aji that were both awesome.  In fact, that chimichurri blew my mind.

I was able to finally check in after 55 minutes of waiting in a long line of absolutely furious customers.

There was ONE employee working the front and although he was a nice guy, he told me that it was impossible that my 2011 Volkswagen was a diesel b/c VW did not make TDI diesels in 2011. He left an entire room of customers to go look at my car to be sure that it was a diesel. The other customers were fuming. I thought one woman was going to have a cardio infarc.  DUH. I know what I've been driving for the past 3 years...But alas, red-faced but polite, he informed me that my car was in fact a diesel.

There were customers in the ""waiting area"", which consisted of 5 chairs, one of whom had been waiting 4.5 hours for an alignment, covered under their warranty plan. Good thing I had a ride and didn't have to wait.

My car was ready in a couple of hours, I guess because I made an appt. I can only imagine the wait if I had not made one. Yet it took almost an hour of waiting in line just to drop off my car.

Tow your car somewhere else or better yet, push it into some other tire place and save yourself hours of waiting & incompetence.

Hadn't gone much in recent years, a few times. Decided to go the other day for a pretty important game to decide the teams who would play the World Series.

Place is much dumpier than I remembered it, but fine. Food was decently priced and seemed fresh enough for a dive bar. Bartender gave us good service as she had a bar full of regulars (at 3:00 pm on a Thursday afternoon) and we were the only table requiring service. 

Two things were problematic for me.

One: A loud-mouthed regular at the bar was blathering on about how he and his wife once walked down the coast in California and came across a nude, gay beach, and went on about how ""[expletive] disgusting"" it was, ad nauseum. Perhaps that isn't a problem the Home Plate can fix, I understand, having spent years in the hospitality business...you can't censor what your customers say. But I'm just mentioning it because if you bring your kids here to use the batting cages, they walk through the bar. The batting cages are in the outdoor area where bar regulars go to smoke. Where said loud-mouthed regular may be mouthing off as well. Is it a big deal? You decide.

Two: The bartender, although she was nice and gave fine service, was complaining about ""WHY is there still baseball in OCTOBER??"" Companion and I were like...you work at a place called Home Plate and are complaining about baseball in October??

There are much better sports bars in Tucson. We won't be back.",2013-10-24 05:46:51,-0.4049502,0.0924405,-0.80840594

Tiny overpriced portions and infuriatingly odd in the way it's prepared and served, one item at a time.  Three TINY meatballs for like 15.00 or about five pieces of okra for 12.00. Even the ""entree"" options are barely even enough for one person much less to share with others.  One of the vegetables we had was corn. And it was supposed to be a creamed corn but it ended up being more of a sauce. Light brown baby poop looking sauce we referred to as goulash because it looked disgusting and didn't taste like corn.  The lamb was served on top of what looked like quinoa but it was some type of strange fat grain but had no taste and a yucky texture.  The quail was about the size of the palm of my hand and was greasy with a thick skin. And the cocktails were terrible. The one I had tasted like it had Worcestershire sauce in it. Bleecgh! 

Short version... Way overpriced. Tiny tiny portions. Food not that good. Sharing tiny portions made it even less enjoyable. Cocktails sucked. No chance I would return.

The waitstaff was really nice and the place looks great and there were a few things that were fun like the fact they bring you your check in an old book. That was cute.  The appetizer we had of whipped fetters cheese and pita bread was delicious.

Although Square 1682 was a pleasant restaurant week experience on the whole and delivered on atmosphere with its warm lighting, cork ceilings and modern earth toned wood fixtures. The chinks in that well polished armor Square 1682 sports became apparent as the evening wore on. Lets begin where the meal ended, shall we?
 
No one likes to have the last impression of a restaurant to be poor. Sadly, this was exactly the case at Square 1682. Nearly every dessert on the restaurant week pre-fixed menu fell short in some small way. Be it ice crystals in the gelato, a pet-peeve of one of my dining associates, to the Caffe con Leche Panna Cotta with steamed milk and an almond-cinnamon biscotti  which was an improvement in the desert spectrum yet carried with it its own fallacies, namely a muted flavor; but this may have been due to the fact that I was drinking a very respectable cappuccino with a mocha flavored dessert. The Apple Cider Fritters with madagascar vanilla bean ice cream and apple cider caramel won out as the best confection in my book. Though deemed too sweet by some in my party, which was true, I found them a perfect with my aforementioned cappuccino. The cinnamon and sugar married well with apple - a welcome update to a classic. Also, an honorable mention should be made to the great biscotti served along side Panna Cotta, they were crisp and yet not in the least stale - a grand accompaniment for the  cappuccino as well. 

As for the main course, well - all I can attest to is that the fish and chips were a grandiose disappointment. Toro was used in place of chips, which only added to the surprising lacking favor. If it were not for the dipping sauces the dish would have had no flavor what-so-ever. I will admit that the dish was not in the least greasy nor was the fish over cooked. It was simply a blank canvas when it came to the flavor profile of the dish as a whole. My dining companions had good things to say about the goat chili and bad things to day about the Lobster Paella but as I did not partake I will refrain from judging.

Finally, there was the creme de la creme of the meal - the appetizer, particularly, the rock octopus with thinly sliced artichoke in a lemon olive oil dressing. This was without a doubt the best part of the meal. The flavors of the dish were harmonious and the texture of the octopus was done just right - resilient but not tough. In fact, I would  be on the merit on this dish alone that I would return to Square 1682.
So, if you find yourself one night sitting in 1682 wondering how to start your meal - heed my advice and get the octopus, then consider getting a drink and hitting the road.",2011-02-23 18:25:36,0.4233065,-0.5318384,-1.1013892

Not busy at all, besides the group of basic teenage girls having a photoshoot in front of the cupcake ATM/storefront. There were a wide variety of choices of flavors, none really blew me away. It was basically chocolate, red velvet, chocolate and vanilla (black and white?) and a few fruit flavors, like strawberry. I didn't see any flavors that I just had to have, so I settled for vanilla with sprinkles instead of the ""dot"" (because why not get sprinkles at Sprinkles). My friend said her banana cupcake was great, but I thought the vanilla was just okay. The vanilla tasted a little dry in my opinion. When I think of cake, I usually prefer it to be slightly moist... The ladies inside were super friendly though and the cupcake ATM is a nice feature. 3.75 for a cupcake vs. 4.25 outside at the cupcake ATM. Convenience fee, perhaps?

My stylist was Lesley (Leslie? - I'm not sure how she spells it); I found her via yelp reviews on the Salon Ricochet page, where she used to work until recently moving to DeCarlo (thanks for the lead everyone!).  Lesley was AMAZING.  

I went into this appointment with some trepidation.  Two days ago I was butchered by an inexperienced student at the Aveda Institute in Queen Village, and so this haircut was initiated as a recovery mission.  It turned out to be so much more.  I have had long hair for most of my life, so when the student at the Aveda Institute cut the angles way too short (and cut them poorly) I was really upset.  There was just no way for it to stay long.  Even with the too-short layers in front due to the student's bad angle job, Lesley managed to give me the cutest haircut I've ever had.  I don't miss the length at all.  

Lesley is also a great conversationalist and just an all around sweet person.  None of those awkward ""what are we supposed to talk about?"" pauses.  I've never had such a good experience with a stylist before.  

On a final note, the price wasn't too bad at $47.  I'm frugal when it come to my hair (hence the Aveda Institute cut from hell which cost me $16), so for me to say I feel this haircut was worth every penny is really saying something.",2009-06-05 20:50:53,-2.1651733,-0.5655387,0.8155245

The dining room has a french country feel and the food presentation is beyond artistic--it's stunning.  You really can't help but ""ohhh and ahhh"" over the plates as they come out.  But the over-the-top presentation and menu prices caused me to have very high expectations.  While the food and overall dining experience was good, I left feeling disappointed.

My meal at Oakley's was rather enjoyable and most of the food was quite good.  In fact, one dish was outstanding.  The suckling pig starter, served with a ricotta crepe and mango puree was heaven.  The meat practically melted in my mouth and the mango flavor was bright and pure.

French onion soup is a deceptively simple dish to make and one that is often not executed well at restaurants.  After the pig starter, I had very high expectations.  I was a little surprised by the presentation.  Instead of the traditional crouton and bubbly cheese on top, the broth was ""naked"" and served along-side a small quesedilla-like grilled cheese sandwich.  While I prefer the traditional presentation, I can appreciate that they were doing something different.  Unfortunately, something went horribly wrong with this soup.  My first bite was more fat than broth and left a greasy feeling in my mouth.  Further inspection revealed a large oil slick on top of the soup.  I don't mean a teaspoon or two of truffle oil, I mean a large quantity of oil.  It was so bad that I'm convinced this is not the way the soup is meant to be served, but rather some sort of mistake.

For the entree, our server recommended the meatloaf.  I've had some really upscale meatloaf dishes recently (such as the Filet Mignon meatloaf at Tavern on South) so I had high hopes.  I was disappointed again.  The flavor of the meat was bland and the chile jam and white cheddar were overpowering.  Even with the accompanying potatoes and vegetables and the artistic presentation, this quite simply was not worthy of the $22 price tag.

The tilapia with sweet corn risotto was one of the better tilapia dishes I've had.  I really enjoyed the sweetness and texture of the risotto, but it was just a bit undercooked.  And the flavors with the tilapia--sun dried tomato puree, morels and hazelnuts were pure genius.  I could have loved this dish if it weren't for the fact that the tilapia was a bit overcooked.  The whole thing left me feeling like Goldilocks with nothing being ""just right"".

Taking the french onion soup out of the equation, the food at Oakley's is quite good, but not good enough to justify the price.",2011-08-02 00:22:44,0.5970417,-0.107859924,-0.41834104

They have more than 10 burger creations in the menu. Rachel Ray would LOVE this place and might try to recreate their burgers for her show. I tried the special burger for that day -  Cajun burger with sweet potato chips, and I love it. The burger is BIG (I could only eat half of it), and the price is reasonable. My husband had the Guacamole bacon burger and he liked it too. The kids' menu is standard, it comes with the drink only. Note that the snow cone is not offered with the kids' meal in this location.

A woman cut right in front of us as we walked up to the hostess stand and got her party of four promptly seated. We then walked up to the hostess.

Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.

While I can not comment on the quality of food I can say their service is absolutely horrendous.

We stayed here because we were running the 1/2 marathon in Nashville and wanted a hotel in close proximity to start of race.

And let me preface this review: We love soul food. That traditional southern home cooking is something we LOVE. And we visit New Orleans a lot, both for business and fun.

First, the good: my husband ordered the fried shrimp and it was served hot and tasty. If you do go, and don't know what to get, order that.

The red beans and rice was a nice mix of meatiness and savoriness. The sauce is a bit watery, but still flavorful (with a little bit of salt). And the waitress - who was not our server, but ended up taking our order after we waited 20+ minutes for someone to stop by and just take our drink order - was very friendly.

Next, the stuff that was so-so: I ordered the meatloaf and it was ... meh. 

Ok, that's being nice. The brown gravy was pretty decent, and I think the meatloaf would have been better if it had been served hot (or even warm) instead of cold. But because it was cold, it had turned gelatinous. (Think head cheese.)

Now, the bad: We waited at the door for more than 15 minutes for someone to ask if we needed a table. I would have understood if the restaurant was packed - I've worked at restaurants before, I get it when the front of the house is slammed. But the place was at least one-third empty.

Every single server who was working walked by U.S. and didn't say a word. Not one ""someone will be right with you"" - not a smile, nothing.

The female server who finally sat us (after we were about to leave) was clearly not having a great night. She pointed at the table, tossed us a couple of menus and then left.

We waited and waited. Ok, maybe they're busy in the back. We waited some more. We tried to make eye contact and smile - nothing.

Then, the other server came over and asked if anyone had taken our order. When we said no, she apologized and took our order.

If the food had been terrific, I could have ignored that first part of the evening. But it wasn't terrific. Most of it was bland - and in desperate need of a pinch or more of salt. 

The biggest problem: half the dishes (Mac and cheese, collard greens, meatloaf) were served either barely lukewarm or cold (like it had been pulled out of a walk-in). And the corn bread was really dry. Like no-amount-of-butter-can-save-this dry.

For $55 - which included two entrees and one glass of whiskey - I can say this was a huge disappointment. We've eaten far better elsewhere in town for the same or less. 

Maybe the staff was having a really off night? Maybe they had a new cook in the kitchen? Me, I'm kind of kicking myself for not checking reviews more closely.",2016-07-07 03:14:45,0.86535925,-0.6092416,0.018605702

I came here this past Tuesday with my boyfriend and we ordered grape leaves, the beef shawarma platter (subbing baba ganouj for hummus), the falafel sandwich, and a tropical smoothie. 

What's good:
-The grape leaves! I'm normally not into grape leaves at all, but ordered them because my SO wanted them. I'm not even sure what exactly was in them (other than rice), but they were amazing. They had a really complex mix of flavor: a bit sour, a bit umami, a bit sweet, which made them really interesting. They also came on a bed of salad, so the entire side was really refreshing.
-The beef shawarma platter: tender, flavorful slices of beef with tzatziki sauce, fluffy and fragrant jasmine rice, creamy baba ghanoj, and a really fresh mix of veggies and feta for the salad. 
-The tropical smoothie: coconut, pineapple, banana, and honey. I find smoothies a bit too sweet generally, but this was perfect. *Even better because you get bits of coconut pieces as you sip! 

What's less good:
-The falafel sandwich: The falafel was crispy and I believe homemade, but bland. I wish it had a bit more flavor, and also that there was more hummus in the sandwich.
-The pita: not bad, just not great (thin, kind of tough). I don't think their pita is homemade, so that's probably why.

Set your expectations--when vacationing in this area, you have three main flavors of food. Seafood shack stuff, Cuban style, and Latin food.  

Basimo is a simple coffee shop with a modest menu. I got a cafe con leche, prepared in a Latin style (sweetened). I am not partial to sweetened coffee drinks but this was a good rendition.

We also ordered food--simple but we'll executed and health-ish. My wife got the yogurt parfait, loaded with granola, and I got silver dollar pancakes with cheesy eggs. Both hit the spot for a nice breakfast with coffee.

I dock a star because I'd love to see them step up to be a pourover or at least French Press shop (they are fair trade and organic, so why not coax those flavors out).  The guy on duty mentioned he heard his manager mention something about pourover, which is promising.

The other nit is that the prices are way high--$3.50-4 for regular brewed coffee, more for espresso drinks. Get used to it if you are on vacation here. Still worth it relative to the area.

Closest true craft coffee shop is in Dunedin, and I'm not driving 15-20 for coffee when I have a young baby with me on vacation. All in all, Basimo is a very solid shop with potential to be great.",2017-07-23 13:35:07,0.6446955,0.14603326,-0.11377081

Small place, close tables, decorated from about 1975, but looked very clean. Service pretty good. My partner ordered the special of the night Chicken Piccata ($20) and was a 6 out of 10. OK, but nothing special.  We were in the mood for garlic and got our fix with the excellent broccoli AND broccoli rabe sides (10 out of 10)  I got the mussels and spag. which I would rate a 7 out of 10. The mussels were tender, but a little bit on the fishy side, and there were a LOT of them - yikes! I would have rather had a smaller amt. of them but fresher. Spag. was fresh and cooked well and had  juicy garlicky broth. Rolls were outstanding which you always expect in South Philly. We didn't drink cocktails, but did have fresh brewed iced tea which was about as good as iced tea gets. We weren't offered a refill though which was a little disappointing. But they had given us water so we were OK. I think Ralph's is resting on their laurels. Consistently OK food in a cool South Philly location.",2011-06-03 18:46:39,0.13657878,-0.5957669,-0.07975208

I got a pulled chicken sandwich on brioche toast with smoked mozzarella cheese. The chicken tasted OK but it was kind of dry. I guess I should have put some extra sauce on my sandwich. The french fries were crispy and flavorful.

My husband got a brisket sandwich on brioche toast with mozzarella cheese, a side of cole slaw and an order of dry rub wings. The brisket was so fatty that my husband left most of the sandwich uneaten. The cole slaw was tasty but the dry rub wings were overcooked and dry. They looked burnt to me...

I understand it's an ER but the wait time was insane. I went in and someone came out to triage us. They took my dog to the back. I waited for about 2 hours until 9 PM to finally talk to the vet student, who took a history. Then, I waited another hour until 10 PM to actually speak with the vet. He said my dog would need sedation in order to get stitches for the cut. He told me about the possibility of getting a drain put in too if the wound was deep. He gave me an estimate of the cost, which actually was pretty accurate in the end. For the sedation, there needs to be a dedicated vet with him the whole time, which means that vet wouldn't be able to see another other animals, and since my dog was stable, he said he wouldn't be able to get to him right away. He estimated at least another 2 hours (midnight) before they could even start on him. He gave me the option of staying or going home and picking him up when it was done. I decided to go home as I had already been there 3 hours, and I lived close by. He said he would call as soon as he was done with the procedure.

We found a warm bustling place with a nice Saturday night feel and some decent barbecue.  Hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect; both St Louis style and back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and sausage (what no goat? Oh well.)  Hendricks has a seriously large menu, obviously centered around barbecue, but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat.

We had a great waiter, Aaron.  He was well informed ( I was impressed that he actually knew the definition of St Louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a Pick 2 platter, he informed us that each couple could split The Whole Shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price, so that is what we did.  Apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce, which ""meats"" with my approval.  There are four sauces on the table.  Each of these trays of meat comes with four sides; so Ms T and I had two slaws, greens and sweet potato fries.  The D's added cheddar grits, sweet potato casserole, green beans and baked beans.  So here we go from first to worst.

Hendricks makes good ribs.  Both the St Louis style and the back ribs were smoky, moist, tender and nicely seasoned with rub.  The rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness.  If it were over-applied, it would be too sweet, but it was in the proper proportion.  I would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other.

Next for me was the pulled pork.  I am not a fan of pulled pork in Missouri.  Often it is in large hunks and dry.  This was pulled to bite size and was moist, but not wet.  I would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs.

The brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods.  It had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor.  It was nice and tender, but was on the edge of dry.  This would also make a good sandwich, but might require some mayo to lube it up.  I know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket.  This is also worth ordering but at least this one night, was not quite as good as PM in Chesterfield  Valley.  Still pretty good for Missouri.

Turkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and I would not re-order them.  Turkey is always a real gamble.  If it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced, before any juices run out, it can be magnificent, as we experienced at Black's Barbecue in Texas.  This had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry.  It was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible.  I just would not order it again, though on another night it might be fine.  

The sausage was, hmmmm.  I almost liked it.  It was not like Hillshire Farms (a point in its favor).  It had some nice heat, Ms T and the D's found it too spicy but it is not really.  I like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in Texas.  They can be sensational.  My issue with this was that it tasted like Pine Sol.  This is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor.  Is it juniper berries?  A-1 Steak Sauce kind of has the Pine Sol thing going, maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix.  Whatever, all I can think of is ""the Power of Pine Sol, Baby"" when eating it.  I'll pass on that next time.

Sides - Ms D declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can.  (try some at Alcenia's in Memphis) They loved the sweet potato casserole, likening it to dessert.  They liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans.  I did not sample them.  Aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion.  

The only think Aaron was not accurate on was the slaw.  He thought it had no onion, but that was all I could taste.  This is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in Carolina.  It is unique, but inedible.  This was one of those rare times when we left the slaw.  It is unspeakably bad.  The sweet potato fries were fine.  The collard greens with bacon were good.  They were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat.  I enjoyed them.  There are even more sides to try.

Hendricks was worth the drive on a winter night.  I think we need to meet our St Charles friends, the L's there.  So go, have some ribs, maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  You will want to bring your own slaw.  I'm going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs.",2013-02-23 14:58:27,0.34492084,0.009082479,-0.27524647

I usually get the cheeseburger with mayo, tomato, and lettuce. The burger is thick and fits the bun well, unlike places like In-n-Out on the west coast where the bun gets a little lost and has a slightly sweet taste. Elevation burgers are as good as Five Guys burgers, and I think the fries are better too, since I love the thinner cut and the inclusion of many crispy ""skin fries,"" which is what I call those little french fries that came from the edge of the potato, where they are more skin and less potato.

We went out of eat last minute and we decided to go to Black Horse Diner because my boyfriends parents used to go there and it was good. We went with 6 people, and one handicapped. When we arrived we had to wait for a host for round about five minutes (and it's not THAT big of a place), and then they had no room for us. The guy  kept looking around and shrugging, then eventually they pulled a few tables together and shoved us in the corner. We were up against an ""emergency exit"" door and couldn't get up without almost opening it.

So once we were eventually sitting down we waited for the waitress, who was nice, but wasn't very good at what she did. We ordered drinks and an appetizer. We NEVER got the appetizer. We also didn't see the waitress again until our food was  brought out (we order along with the appetizer because we knew what we wanted).

So our food comes out and she couldn't remember who had what, and our table was already cluttered from the around of uncleared cups. I got the linguine with alfredo and chicken, and it was DISGUSTING! Never ever get this. I couldn't eat it, it honestly looked like slop, there was no taste at all- the chicken- you couldn't tell it was chicken. The noodles were severely overcooked and also had no taste, and the alfredo sauce wasn't alfredo sauce, and if it was it must have been week old alfredo sauce.

Out of six people, only three people ended up being okay with their meals. One was a cheese-steak, one was a tuna sandwich, and the other was a hoagie (but that wasn't even eaten at the restaurant, it was to go). My boyfriend's dad got the seafood platter which he didn't finish because it was too bland, and his sister didn't finish her food because it tasted weird.

As if things couldn't get any worse, they were trying to film a commercial for the place so the photographer was going around taking pictures of people. He took pictures of us without our permission, and we had to tell him no because we didn't want our pictures taken (especially not to promote a place that we just had bad food). He gave us a dirty look and moved on.

So because I was still starving because I now didn't have dinner, we were getting ready to go but decided to get dessert. Only two people got dessert, me and our handicapped uncle, I tried to get there triple chocolate cake (which the waitress said they didn't have), so just got the regular- and that was okay. And my uncle got the icecream. 

For a $90 bill, it wasn't worth it. It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had in  a restaurant. We didn't send the food back because we couldn't even get our waitress for more than two seconds. Thinking of that meal I got still makes me feel queasy. 

Upon leaving we didn't get any farewell, but my boyfriend's dad stayed behind to talk to someone about the food. We waited 20 more minutes and according to my  boyfriend's dad the manager ""didn't seem to care at all about whether or not we liked the food or service"". 

It was honestly a waste of time and money. Save your money and go somewhere else.",2012-06-01 15:31:28,-1.0599806,-0.8487116,-1.4048545

I'm so glad I finally made it in! I went with my boyfriend, who studied abroad in Paris for a year and a half and is very familiar with a Parisian style patisserie. He was so excited that something of the sort could be found in NOLA. 

Upon entering, we were treated to a tempting display counter filled with a variety of different French pastries. After browsing the extensive selection we decided on the Opera cake, a chocolate croissant and a ham and cheese croissant. 

My boyfriend couldn't get over how comprable everything was to a Patisserie that could be found in Paris. The Opera cake and croissants were as good if not better than what could be found in the best of pastry shops in France. 

The chocolate croissant was decadent, filled with delicious dark chocolate and the texture of the croissant was flaky and crispy. A perfectly made pastry.

The ham and cheese croissant was filled with delicious ham and gruyere cheese. Fantastic. 

And the opera cake? Don't get me started on the opera cake. It had layer upon layer of sweet and delicious fillings and cake. The bf swears that Maple Street Patisserie's version is better than anything that could be found in Paris.

As a former NYCer i was real excited to take a visit here due to the NYC theme of the restaurant. As soon as you step inside i immediately had flash backs of the city as I felt like i was transported back to NYC. With familiar NY subway signs & NY sports pictures plastered all over the wall i felt at home. The walls were also covered with badges from various NYPD, FDNY & EMT departments from back home which added a cool touch to the restaurant. You could really tell that the owners put alot of time into this restaurant as there's just so much memorabilia to glance at! 

As for the pizza, I could tell the quality of the ingredients they used was fresh. when i took a bite of my slice, the mozzarella stuck to the crust causing the strands to slowly pull away and just proves the quality of their cheese. I always order my pizza extra crispy and as some places may tend to over cook my order, Precinct cooked mines to perfection! A slice was $2.65 which is not bad considering i was used to paying $2.75 for a slice back home. 

... but what really blew me away was their garlic knots. MY god these might have been the BEST GARLIC KNOTS i have ever had in my life ... maybe even better than the ones i have had in a NYC pizzeria! Each knot was HUGE & had a little burn to it which gave each piece an excellent crisp. We ordered 4 and they covered the whole basket it was served in. Not too obnoxious with being overly garlicy, it was a nice combination and went well with the marinara sauce they served it with. this should be a MUST with every order.

and the canolis ... leave the gun take the cannoli (sorry couldn't resist!)  ... I haven't had a good one since walking the streets in little italy. this one was freaking amazing. Loved the chocolate chips it was served with! A great way to cap the meal!

We were surrounded by different options and she saw [Jazz] open for breakfast, New Orleans style food so she was sold!! When you walk in you can see the potential in it, though the decor was to dark especially during the day you could see the vision they had for when it was a Jazz night.

Every thing that came out you can tell there is no love being put into these dishes. Every last one looked like something you can make at home and even better looking as well.

Choice of fresh fruit, grits or brabant potato. When the plate arrived no ham [for it wasn't thawed] So they replaced it with bacon. I wasn't asked if I wanted grits or fruit they just decided for me and did put what suppose to be a fancier named for home fries [Brabant potato].

The food was something a guy might try to make to impress his girlfriend that spend the night. I do believe a real CHEF is needed and not that average Joe they have back there cooking. Because nothing is New Orleans about their food. I can see why this place is empty and Starbucks is winning. Goes to show you people would rather have microwave food then this establishment food.

One of the women with us, who had waitressed in a prior life, actually considered pulling the girl aside and explaining to her how much she was losing in tips.  And it is a tiny dining room and the place was mostly empty until about 5 PM.

But, the service was one star at the Southport Indiana location on the evening of Sunday, June 15, 2014.  I will gladly change my review to 3 stars if management responds to this review that they have made corrections.  Our kids' dance studio filled up the place with customers.  Studio staff called 4 months in advance and again 2 weeks in advance to let them know we were coming and for the restaurant to make arrangements to staff accordingly (since Sunday nights are normally quiet).  We arrived and were seated.  The staff seemed to have expected us by their comments.  Orders were wrong at our table from the beginning, and three people at our table waited over 1.5 hours for their food.  Drinks were served randomly, sometimes before food arrived and sometimes with the food.  When we flagged the waitress to explain that she needed to bring chips or something for the three people waiting over an hour for their food she ignored our request.  We spoke to the manager and asked for the same thing.  Request ignored.  After an hour and 20 minutes the waitress asked if she should bring some chips for these folks.  Yes!  20 minutes later she delivered the chips with the food that finally took an hour and 45 minutes.  We had repeatedly flagged the manager throughout this process.  His answer:  There are 150 people here!  Then, the person who waited the longest for her meal (she got it around 10:30 PM) was double charged for drinks, charged for the chips, and charged for the wrong meal that they had brought her at the 1 hour mark.  That's right, they brought her the wrong meal an hour into her wait.  When the manager came to correct her bill, he made it sound like he was doing her a favor by removing the errors.  I politely explained that he and his staff could have listened to our repeated request of, ""please bring something for our three friends to munch on since it's been over an hour.""  The manager cut me off with his new mantra, ""there are 150 people here!""  I would say this to his upper management: Your manager on that night was unqualified to manage your restaurant.  If indeed your restaurant cannot serve a full house of customers, then you need to close down part of it and serve only a limited number.  Do not tell your customers they are an imposition.  The mistakes by staff were forgivable up to the point the manager made excuses.  When I compared notes with other customers from our kids' dance studio, they had similar experiences, and with the same excuse from the second manager on duty, ""there are 150 people here!""  Well, there might have been 100 people in the restaurant at its peak.  When I got there early and it was practically empty, they managed to get my appetizer wrong.  So, clearly the staff and management are not properly trained to provide adequate service even with a few customers.",2014-06-16 16:34:54,-0.4785161,-0.7442277,-0.86714476

My daughter ordered a California roll from kids menu, and it came out with a very cute 2 components bento box which had cali roll and fries, my daughter chose an organic milk with her meal and total was only $6. 

My wife and I ordered a bento box, hot and sour soup was delivered to our table right after we sat down. Soup was very tasteful, chicken teriyaki in the box was perfectly cooked, it was tender and there was a baby bok-choy vegetable underneath the meat and it was yummy with the sauce. There were two pieces of vege spring rolls came with the box, extremely fresh, vegetables inside was crunchy and had lots of flavors. The portion of the bento box was so big that my wife ahd to ask me to share with her. 

I ordered couple of special rolls because I noticed the price is fairly cheap like only $11, for most of sushi restaurants probably will charge $13-$14. Pop this roll is a cooked roll, I also ordered Ocean waves which has raw tuna and salmon on top. I got my rolls less than 10 minutes with the bento box, we were kinda surprised by how fast they make sushi. The presentation of the roll was great, rice melted in my mouth and they were full of flavors with the sauces, the raw fish was extremely fresh, I have to say they are definitely one of the best sushi i ever had.

I said I understood the policy for busy nights, and in the future we'd certainly abide by it, but since there was no one waiting for a table it couldn't hurt for me to sit down.

It's a good thing that we played it safe and made a reservation because there were three folks in front of us who got turned away because there was no availability.  This place appears to be the epicenter of business lunches! I felt so sophisticated just being in there! Refer to the following delicious points: 1. Mango iced tea.  I usually prefer unflavored sweet tea, but I chose to try it as my lunch dates insisted on it's deliciousness. It was pretty good. The ice tea wasn't sweetened, but on the table was a miniature pitcher of liquid sugar! Fancy! 2. The bread. Spicy Onion Focaccia. Soooo good! 3. The bread was served with butter on the side, of course, with a sprinkling of pink Himalayan salt. Again, fancy! 4. Musroom Bisque. I'm a huge meat eater, but this soup was to DIE FOR! It was topped with truffle cream. You HAVE to get a cup! 5. Chicken Pad Thai. I was a little nervous to try this Asian dish in a non-Asian restaurant, but it was pretty tasty. Usually, I would not have ordered it since this was not a Thai restaurant, but my lunch dates raved about it's deliciousness. It had a very fresh taste, and it's worth a try. There were also generous bits of tofu in the Pad Thai as well. 6. Yukon Potato Pizza. I had a slice from the plate of one of my lunch dates. I personally wouldn't order it (only because it's not my thing , not because it wasn't tasty). It tasted like a loaded baked potato on a pizza.

So I am on vacation and decide that my hair is grossly out of whack, probably a month overdue for a good cut.  Go to Yelp, see if I can find a highly rated nearby location for a last minute appointment, and find Salon Ya Ya.  

The first Salon Ya Ya I called apologetically referred me to their second store.  It was with trepidation that I made that second call.  At first it seemed I'd be shut out, nothing available, but David worked hard to fit me in and set me up with Candace.  He told me I would need at least an hour for the personal level of service they give.  Actually my ADD side was glad for the warning, because he was right. 

In a nutshell:
- comfortable and sophisticated vibe
- solid line of professional products and interesting treats (jewelry, make-up)
- comfy chairs at the wash basins
- bright but not blinding colors and lighting
- clean
- genuinely happy people (is that a Nashville thing?) work to serve you
- cuts and services priced based on the experience of the professional

Candace spent time but more importantly gave her full attention to the state of my hair, the shape of the cut and my face and the whole shibang.  She explained what she was doing and why as she went along.  The result was perfect according to my criteria: no one noticed I'd had 2.5 inches taken off!",2011-03-22 03:39:31,-1.9280759,-0.32733908,0.14785476

The place was not crowded however with the few patrons that were that made it feel a little cramped.

However after another ten minutes of waiting, mind you it is no one else there but me at the front counter. She answers the phone, WTF... (Ready to walk out).

He was pleasant and made my order promptly, about ten minutes later he asks the cashier to rung up my order. It was just something with her, she never smiled and nor even at this point acknowledge me. She just stated what I owed, then hands me my change. No thank you or have nice day. Nothing!

+Chicken Katsu ($5 + 50cents for egg): substantially-sized, crunchy chicken strips with rice, tomato chunks, and sesame seeds in tonkatsu sauce 
+Red veggie curry ($5): potato and pumpkin chunks with rice in a creamy curry broth, DELICIOUS. Spice level is perfect.
+Cap'n Crunch encrusted tilapia burrito($6): slightly sweet, crunchy, and flavorful; generously portioned. Don't miss out on this one!
+Mexican veggie burger ($4): I'm not a vegetarian but I really wouldn't miss meat if I could eat this daily. Love the spicy mayo!
+Thai ice tea/thai green tea ($2): refreshing, not too sweet, waaay better than starbucks

Owners are super gracious and friendly. They really care about their customers since they make an effort to engage in conversation with you.

Only downsides:
-Some of their menu choices take a long time like the Tilapia, especially during the lunch rush (~15 minute wait) but totally worth it
-Random closings. I've been here a couple of times only to find them closed. A few weeks ago, I dragged my friend after class to try my favorite food truck. We were so disappointed that we trekked all the way from Penn only to find Cucina to be closed. I wish they were a bit more consistent with their schedule.

All in all, Cucina Zapata is a safe bet for an affordable and delicious meal. I'm a huge fan!",2012-05-02 01:30:39,0.24649194,-0.19650431,0.65701467

So if you aren't vegan, veggie or gluten-free, carry on to the next review!!

So, I have to be honest, I was sort of looking forward to eating at Ralph's on the Park to see what deliciousness they could come up with since there are definitely no vegan entrees on the menu.  They cooked up a stir-fry for me, which was DELICIOUS!  It consisted of some lovely mushrooms, green beans, squash, roasted tomatoes and a balsamic reduction.  It was all very tasty and maybe one and a quarter cups worth of veggies MAX!   Which would have maybe been okay, but they charged me for the gnocchi dish (which obviously has more substance than veggies stir-fried).  

Twenty-five bucks for the stir-fry (without tax or tip), and I was a starving girl a mere hour later!  Meh.... my parents want to go to Ralph's the next time they are in town; I will be sure to eat ahead and just join them for drinks....",2012-04-02 01:45:45,0.62673044,-0.43166906,0.8957333

The main issue lies within the compact entrance which leaves little to no room for people to migrate into a manageable clump. Instead, we piled up like herded sheep around the register, then piled out the front door. Luckily, it was a mildly warm, sunny day so most of the crowd felt rather patient. However, I do NOT recommend coming here at peak brunch hours or evening dinner hours near weekends. My friends and I arrived at 12:30pm Saturday prime time lunch. We were able to sit with a lovely individual, but our food took app. 45 minutes before it came out. When I asked a staff member, she told me they were backed up from the whole lunch crowd. So, definitely order an appetizer (I recommend the queso) if you're waiting.

The outdoor seating is quite sidewalk-chic, if you know what I mean. Lots of large picnic tables and plenty of room for pets. They even provide dog bowls if Fido needs a drink of water. The picnic tables, I would say, are also their greatest downfall. Unless you're ok with sharing room family style (which we were), you might prefer indoor seating or taking it to-go.

Food was...less stellar than expected. I had the Korean BBQ and Brisket tacos.The meat was quite tender for the brisket, and I found the pickled red onions added just the right amount of sourness. I was disappointed by the Korean BBQ, a decent but lackluster mixture of chopped cabbage, carrots, and a slightly marinated bulgogi-ish meat. The star of my meal was the fried green chile mac n' cheese. Absolute cholesterol-inducing perfection. This made the meal worth the crazy line.

I would say, if you haven't had Tex-Mex in Texas, give it a shot. If you have, this might not be the best wait.",2016-02-01 19:33:18,0.07474449,-0.28894514,-0.5818023

Some of the front desk girls were very helpful, but one of them in particular was very sarcastic.

Hearing this information I decided to give LA Nails a try since they were new, in a convenient place, and had reasonable prices.

It was my first time going to the salon and my first impression was that everyone was nice and everything was clean. However...

I chose my polish and was immediately able to be seated. The girl who did my nails was very nice and paid great attention to filing and cutting the cuticles. I did notice that she did not seem to fully understand how to work the pedicure chair's water temp control or what she was suppose to do next during the whole process (it being a new salon understood/maybe because of the different pedicure options or she just started in this profession? - not sure). I can say that she gave my legs a nice massage, probably 5 minutes per leg which was longer than I have had done before. She did a nice job polishing my toes and had gone back to file and remove extra polish she got on my skin. Another lady came to put a flower design and then applied a top coat. When it was time to pay, I was told it was $25 when I was under the impression it was $20 for the pedicure + $3 for the nail art as described in their menu. I didn't say anything as I was planning on playing $30 total, just preferred that the girl who did the work got more of a tip.

Upon getting home to take a closer look at the job that was done, I noticed that there was still some dead skin left on my feet near my toes. This may have been because a brush was not used all over my foot like I have had done before (although she did use a pumice sponge for my callouses on the bottom only). I also noticed that a few (3 or 4) of my toe nails were not buffed down to be smooth at the end - this being because she only used a nail buffer once to help file one toe rather that on all of my toes, which again, I have had done in the past before.

Overall, this salon is OK. The price is pretty competitive compared to other salons around here - though I did have the issue with the total cost being different from what was mentioned in the menu. I spent $30 total which I would expect for a pedicure with tip around this area; however I have had a much better pedicure done for about the same price and would be willing to spend the extra money to get to done to my satisfaction. I will go to other salons to compare them to here before coming back.",2015-01-04 23:39:18,-1.759401,-0.62729025,0.8587551

I think I went to go wash my hands, as the two appetizers sat in the plate untouched being that my wife gave me a clear ""you're going to eat that AND a BBQ platter!!!"" Look, I just got back to eat that appetizer. When my wife exclaimed ""that was really good"". We should have just gotten 10 taco appetizers.  As the bbq portions were kinda small, and even though the BBQ was good, it was frequently cooked (down) with bel-peppers, onions, and tobacco.  Which made much of it as spicy.

This is our 5th September living in the area but we just finally made it to this event for the first time.  We will most certainly be back.

A few thoughts and musings...

+ Wear comfortable shoes!
+ Know that the majority of what you see is likely to be more than you want to spend.  Somebody must be buying it though, none of the artists appeared to be starving.
+ Understand that this is a competitive juried event (no idea what that means but one of the artists told us so apparently it is important).
+ It takes a good half-day to browse slightly rapidly - allow more time if you want to delve deeper and discuss a lot.
- WTH is wrong with the parents who were hauling their kids around in wagons and had them plugged in to electronic babysitters.  Really people?  Really?!?  
- Smokers...seriously...can't Clayton just go ahead and make this a non-smoking event like a Cards game?  Just because we are all outside together doesn't mean we need to be harassed by your second-hand filth.

Pro tips...

* The Kobe sliders at Ruth's Chris were the most appealing food item to me.  They were two for $6 and worth every penny.  
* Hit World News for a big bottle of water that costs less than the small bottles at the event places.  
* Take a break in the shade at Barcelona and have a nice cold bowl of gazpacho.  It really hits the spot on a warm afternoon.",2017-09-10 14:20:08,-0.99821067,-0.21765043,-0.037725084

I had been planning on visiting Pennhurst all season and was excited to visit on the last weekend it was open. 

I had heard horror stories of shuttle buses and long lines. We didn't have to use shuttle buses (maybe it was because we went after Halloween). We did splurge for the VIP passes and felt that they were well worth it. There were still long lines and we were able to move between the attractions quickly. 

The asylum is filled with talented actors.  A lot of money has gone into this place and you can tell. I've never seen such great makeup and effects go into a haunted house. The actors touch you more than any other place I've been to. They play with your hair, give you jumper cables, rub wet things in your face. It's creepy!!

The tunnel was unlike anything I've experienced. Tight places, pitch black, clowns etc. At the end there was a guy who came to me and asked me if he could have my arm. I laughed and said ""yeah sure buddy"". He then surprised me by revving a chainsaw with no blade. As soon as it hit my arm, I ran like hell out of there. I had never been scared like that.

I say this to establish my reverse cred. I have never had Vietnamese food in New York or L.A. All I know has been gleaned from a couple of restaurants right here in Nashville. So for the pho pros out there please take this review with a grain of salt.

Walking in you see rows of cafeteria type tables, the decor is sparse but it's clean and well lit. Service was well...serviceable. But let's be honest I wasn't here for ambiance it was 19 degrees outside what I wanted was a bowl of hot soup the size of a hot tub.

I ordered spring rolls with shrimp and pork then pho with rare beef and meatballs.  The rolls were fresh and crunchy and came out very quickly. Before I could scarf down the first one my vat of steamy soup arrived.  Very nicely presented with the usual accompaniments; jalapeño, Thai basil and bean sprouts. The broth was rich and deeply flavored but with a hint of acid to lighten it up.  The meatballs were great and the beef was good. But the broth! Wow.

This was a very different pho from Peace, Love... Darker and more complex. I can't decide which I like better but then I know where they both are and I have a car so I can have both. 

The area around Kien Giang is practically littered with Vietnamese restaurants. I'm sure they all are very good but in my limited experience I have to say that the pho at Kien Giang is darned tasty.  Also for $10.00 I got a tub of soup, 2 fresh spring rolls and a pot of hot tea. This is a winner.",2015-02-19 19:35:39,0.15063542,-0.3067675,0.29298145

This one is the older location, and it goes without saying to avoid this place at all cost. As an avid buffeter (yes I just made up the word), I came to this place a lot. Now that I've matured and actually want quality buffet (and other quality food served at sit-downs), this place was not of the first to get the axe of places to go.

If you are looking for a quiet meal, don't step inside this place. Kids run around screaming everywhere. Parents are loud and obnoxious (and sometimes borderline abusive to their kids), and many people are rude when trying to get the food on their plates.

When it comes to healthy food, I'm convinced all of Golden Corral is bad. I've observed, specifically at this location, items like the coleslaw, tuna salad, and potato salad coming out a can, the lettuce and spinach is never kept at a cool temperature, and the hot veggies (ie the carrots, the broccoli) taste like they came out a microwave. But that desert bar seems constantly well-maintained and every fried food available cooked fresh. In other words, the they successfully make healthy food taste so bad that that you get so angry and thus has to devour yourself in all it's high-calorie, heart-disease diabetic-causing food.

Customer service was not this location's specialty. I only had one good waiter who has been with the Golden Corral franchise since they had a location at 1st Ave and Wetmore. I always have an eye and an ear open on the employees. They have little interest in ensuring the customers are happy. Then again, some of the customers there are not worth giving good service to. I say this with the mindset that one of the problems in this country is that parents (and many individuals for that matter), don't care about what foods we are feeding ourselves and our children. Sorry for going off-topic.

To summarize, eating at this location is terrible. The new location on Thornydale has much better customer service and has a bigger selection of foods, including healthy options (still not the best, but better). In fact, i was at the other one recently and enjoyed it.

Pho with different kinds of meat (steak, tendon, tripe, fatty flank): the broth was very flavourful.

I didn't get as much variety of herbs as I would have liked, but the bowl was nice & comforting, all in all.

Lemongrass beef slices: very tasty, great flavour, well-grilled, fragrant with scallions on top.  The menu described the dish as having ""Fresh Vegetables"" but it was just some shreds of lettuce at the bottom of the plate.  Kind of annoying, because I wanted veggies, but I'll just have to come back next time & ask for more info while ordering.

Came in on a Wednesday night around 8 o'clock to a dimly lit, friendly-faced, moderately occupied restaurant. We were able to grab a table right away and considering it was such a nice night, we decided to step out back to dine in the courtyard.

There's plenty of seating here, they've done well with the tight warehouse district space. Our server was friendly, but the service was standard. I remember it taking a moment to get our orders together as they input them using an iPad. Seems their U.I. could use a little upgrade for user friendliness.

Margaritas were pretty good, I usually get headaches from em' but I also didn't pound four of them. For the app we got the tres queso (didn't add any meat) which was nice. Came with a ton of chips and you're gonna want to get at that queso fast because we all know what happens when we let it sit for a few minutes. I would have liked a little more of a spicy kick in the queso tho, but I'd get them again.

My date ordered the sweet potato quesadilla witch she (and i) liked a lot, careful tho because they come out HOT! I went with the fuego burrito with a salad and that thing was massive! It's rare that I have to box up a meal but I had to, I would've died trying to put it all away that night. It could have been all the chips I decimated also.

The two of us ate for about $30 or so, not a bad deal. I can see myself returning for more, we were very pleased with the food.

One more thing, my date had been here before and they charged her for something that was wrong, so long story short, she was told that they would put her name in ""the book"" and they would take care of it next time. Well folks, there is no ""the book"" so if it happens to you, don't fall for it. Get something written from management.

****UPDATE****
My date clarified that there IS in fact a book. My Apologies to any staff affected.

It is a great place if you live downtown for sure. They have a small grocery as well as a cafe inside as well. They have a lot of 'organic-esque' items; things that you would typically find at whole foods in here. They have anything from hot sauce, to gluten free pasta,  breakfast items, baking items, sweet treats, well just a little bit of everything. They also have a decent selection of wine and craft beers.  They also have a cold section with some to-go food and local items. One thing I did get was local made feta dip and it was AMAZING!

And after my meal tonight at Little Thai Cafe (LTC), I can definitely add it to the list.  There's a reason all the review sites have raved about this place.

LTC is in a small plaza about a mile south of downtown Tarpon Springs.   There are about 40 seats, and the decor is simple, but still inviting.  I was seated immediately, and dug into the menu.  The complete menu is available on their website, and for a restaurant this size, I think there's an excellent variety of apps, soups, salads, specials, entrees and noodles, many which make me want to come back and check out.  Prices are very reasonable, with almost all of the dishes except for specials are under $9.   The menu notes all the dishes that are mildly spiced, but they can take it up about 3 notches if you want that extra kick.  Order taking was quick, I decided to stick with the basics on this visit, and chose pad thai with chicken along with their wonton soup.

A few moments later, my large bowl of soup arrived, and there is definitely no lukewarm soup here....it was steaming hot and smelled great.  While the exterior and interior of Little Thai Cafe may be simple, the flavors coming from the kitchen are not.  Just excellent complex combinations of abundant fresh ingredients, well-seasoned flavors, and cooked extremely well.  LTC transformed a simple wonton soup into a rich mix of fresh taste, adding shredded cabbage, carrots, snow peas, broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn, and celery to a tasty light broth, pieces of chicken and a ground chicken wonton.  The mix of ingredients had each vegetable well cooked, yet slightly crisp, and the soup stayed very hot to the last drop..  I've never had a wonton soup with so many ingredients, but they all worked together perfectly, and it was one of the best wonton soups I've ever had.

Before I could finish the hot soup, the excellent pad thai arrived, and the ingredients and seasonings were all balanced, and worked together very well.  And the noodles had just the right amount of sauce on them.  The serving was so large I has to stop halfway through and take home the rest.  Everything that landed on the table was so good I'm anxious to get back and check out the rest of the menu.

On the way out the door I chatted with the owner about the food and Thailand.  He told me they search for the finest ingredients, and use no MSG.   As MSG isn't used and , they have to work hard to compensate by finding just the right seasonings that work well for U.S. tastes.  And while much typical/authentic Thai food would be much hotter spiced, as most American palates can't handle it they've made sure their flavors are rich and work well regardless of how hot you order it.  I was impressed by his passion for his food, and the focus on what his customers want.  It definitely translates to what lands on your plate and palate.  My scores on a local Asian restaurant scale.

Update:  11/8/11

Food was so good on my visit last weekend I had to get back there and try their lunch menu.  Had the pad basil, which had a fine mix of veggies and chicken in a sauce that built up some heat slowly.  Not too much, just right.  A big mound of white rice is on the side, perfectly cooked.   Throw in a small soup and egg roll all for only $7?  Bargain.  Also tried their Chang beer from Thailand....served with a very chilled glass, very nice.  A light, smooth and flavorful lager that perfectly complemented the heat of the pad basil.  A card on the table said it's Thailand''s most popular beer.  I understand why.  Hope I can find it in bulk somewhere.",2011-11-06 03:33:07,-0.15620472,0.645417,-0.11175641

pontalba is a milestone restaurant for me because it was crowned as the first place i ever got to try alligator. and blackened, at that. it was AMAZING. and seriously, it really does taste like chicken.

for my main course, i had the ragin' cajun pasta. for a first dinner in new orleans, this hit all the right spots. gulf shrimp, andouille sausage, and crawfish tails simmered in a spicy cream sauce and served atop a bed of fettucine. if that doesn't win you over, check out my picture of it. the pasta also had a little cup of parmesan with it, but i found that i didn't need it. the meat and seafood was generous and the cajun heat was exactly what i was looking for. all food came with garlic bread, and it was honestly some of the best garlic bread i've had: thick chunks of french bread, buttered up real good, with garlic and chives sprinkled on top. MMM!

i've also included a picture of the seafood platter, which a friend of mine got and just couldn't even put a dent into it because there was so much goodness. for $19.95, you get fish, shrimp, oysters, and a crabcake. all fried. with fries.

our waiter mickey was incredibly helpful, and the chef even came out to answer questions, but the removal of a star is due to the teeny and really kind of gross bathroom. there is one stall in a TINY room, with toilet paper all over the floor, garbage overflowing from the bin, and the sink had wads of paper towel in it. really?? this was especially shocking because the restaurant itself is pretty nice. i suppose you can't win 'em all.

so basically..enjoy the food but opt for a different lavatory.",2010-03-14 21:22:31,1.0233581,-0.47953674,-0.5594827

If you go to Rons expecting a healthy; well balanced Italian dinner, better look twice at the menu.  When you order a full entree such as a Veal Parm dinner for $20.00, it doesn't even come with a vegetable or salad while their basic entrees do.

If you want Broccoli or similar,. that is an extra $5.00 !!  Salad is $2.00.  I'm not one to complain or usually even compare a couple dollars one way or the other, but for a place that advertises family friendly, and full, HEALTHY meals (explicitly not a la carte), this is absurd.  

Aside from that and having a very poor server on our last trip, the beer selection and the quality of the food here is solid.  They do have a great rotating tap and very friendly / attentive bartenders.  

The bar,  food quality (which you definitely pay for) and happy hour specials are why I couldn't give it 2 stars in all good conscience, and would maybe even make it a 4, but the waitress service would bring it down to 3.

If you're looking for a place where you can get a dependable, affordable, and head-turning haircut; her name is Crystal, and she works at Plume Salon. Sit down in Crystal's chair and within five minutes you'll know, your hair is one less thing you have to worry about. Whether you want classic and easy or hipster and fun, after one cut, you'll book your appointments for the next two months. (Bonus: you can book your appointments online.)

I've been coming to Crystal for about five years now. I followed her from a former salon to Plume. The staff here are wonderful! They are always friendly, offer you a drink, and make sure you're booked for you next appointment if needed. With competitive prices, this place is the trifecta of: high quality cuts, great customer experience, and easy/affordable.

Crystal is not only brilliant in her craft, she's a blast to know and talk to. Not only does she keep my head looking great and easy to keep up, but I also walk away most weeks with an insider tip on a new restaurant or dish to try somewhere in the city.

There are two things every guy needs to have a dependable pro for, a tailor and a haircut. Mark this one off your list.",2018-02-11 21:02:28,-1.9985572,0.28226328,1.1942841

I stumbled on this place today when I was running into Publix to grab lunch.  You almost could miss it if you weren't looking for it.

The workers (maybe owners) are French, and are as nice as can be.  I wanted to try one of everything in the shop. I settled on a sandwich with fresh prosciutto, basil and cheese, on a delicious baguette.  It was so good.  Their pastries looked like they were to die for, so I'll definitely have to try one of those next time.  They also have salads and sandwiches on toasted croissants and endless coffee drink options.

There was a ton of hype leading up to the Market Goes Mexican release and yes, I was excited. But when you really think about it, the Mexican vibe does not go with Oxford Exchange. They were blaring Latin music and have added all sorts of pinatas and Our Lady of Guadalupe candles around the place to make it all Mexican.

You can choose your protein, choose your vehicle (aka tortilla or whatever else you want) and then choose three toppings. They do not ask you if you want it for there or to go, so I'm just assuming they make everything to go.

I ordered the spicy pork belly taco with ancho sauce, pico de gallo and blistered shishito peppers. I waited for a little bit to get my taco but it was sort of busy so I didn't really mind. There is basically no space to sit in the place and the guys in front of me had taken up the ENTIRE row so I had to eat outside. No big deal. 

When I got the taco, I was actually really disappointed. You'll see the picture and notice there is basically no pico de gallo on the taco at all. The pork belly wasn't even spicy and was mediocre at best. It had no flavor. The pepper? Meh. The ancho sauce was all over the place and although it tasted good, it was basically the only thing on the taco that I liked.

This is not OE's specialty whatsoever. The food at their regular restaurant is actually pretty good and I quite liked the sandwich aspect of the market because it truly felt like a market. Their juices are actually pretty good -- their almond milk is a good blend and is made fresh. 

The market also has some refrigerated items to take home which looked pretty appetizing. 

But on the whole, this new menu change is a recipe for disaster. OE will get people going there with the hype, but they won't keep them because these tacos are not good. Head to Green Lemon on South Howard for better quality tacos packed full of flavor. Or go to Miguel's. Or anywhere else.

I was going to just do the drive through but she convinced me to eat in... at a stainless steal table where she's also preparing food on...

This place has even more of a feel of a street vendor than the Chao Zhou place.  

Here's how the conversation started (entirely in Mandarin)

Lady:  ""Where are you from?""
Me:  ""Oh I was born in New York...""
Lady:  ""ooooooh ABC ah!""

Btw, ABC stands for American Born Chinese.

So yeah this place just opened up and since it's just one person doing everything, you can't expect the food to come out quickly.  She was super nice and shortly after my food was on the table, these two Chinese UMSL students came in and bantered with her like she was their mom (she wasn't... she told me her life story shortly before...).  If you aren't comfortable with eating IN a small kitchen, I suggest that you call in your order and get stuff to go.  She dooooes accept Discover, but cash is definitely preferred.

As I thanked her for the food, I stepped out... 

Lady:  ""He's an ABC!""
UMSL Student girl:  ""Yeah I figured....""

Onto the food, which is almost all under 6 bucks, btw...

The Dan dan noodles were quite awesome.  It had all the flavor I was looking for.  I have absolutely no need to even bother ordering this anywhere else.  Same for the spicy wonton (hong you cao shou) soup.  These are two dishes I have tried over and over all over St. Louis and was never satisfied until now.  I am totally coming back here to try everything else she has.

*edit:  Brought the wife there aorund 8pm and the lady was like ""why are you eating so late?!""

""Black Sauce Noodle"" (za jiang noodles) which didn't really have black sauce... but was freaking yummy and I'm definitely getting this next time... 

Beef Noodle Soup - more noodles than soup but that's how I like it and it's a great not-too-big portion size for $4.99 too.

Southern comfort mixed with Italian? This should be interesting. But hey, I'm southern and Italian!!
Slow, but we got our hot crispy delicious fried chicken at 10:30. The service was wonderful, menu changes according to season and fall is the highlight now. Pumpkin, squash, apple, flavors if you want. Drink menu is great, wine on tap! 
We had garlic bread, which is served grilled, similar to a bruschetta but YOU control the amount of topping so the bread never get mushy.
We had a fantastic Caesar salad with a fried, soft boiled egg- center oozes out ....yum, yum
Next the signature fried chicken, can it get more perfectly cooked? The pile of breast, thigh, wing and drum was crisp and flavorful with the breast so moist, hats off to the fry man/woman!
Sides were Mac n cheese with corkscrew noodles, breadcrumb topping, fennel-apple slaw.
Yup- welcome to WC

1. People who do circus and teach circus are the best people 
2. Circus is a fun workout and a great way to test your strengths while stepping out of your comfort zone
3. People who attend circus classes are the best type of people

While living in Chicago, I found a Gilt deal for TSNY. I went once. I was hooked (I should prob write a review over there too). It's been a few months now and I've quickly learned that while my natural trapeze talent isn't quite what I hoped, my passion for it is strong. 

While visiting Philly, I decided to check out the rig at the Philadelphia School of Circus Arts because why not? Some people go to cities to eat, I go to new cities to fly. Yolo. I showed up to my class only to be greeted by a very enthusiastic woman named Mary Kelly. She hyped everyone in the class up, got us all ready to go, and gave critical feedback after each turn. I managed to improve my split and was caught at the end!

This school is a bit more expensive than some of the other ones I've attended so far but totally worth it. The outdoor rig is fun and all the people in my class were regulars. Def recommend if you want to try something new, get your heart rate up (25 feet in the air is no joke), and meet some fun people.",2018-09-06 22:11:44,-1.6418612,-0.14651804,0.3879933

let's just say i went to james brown with a certain set of presumptions.  i will just come right out and say it -- i thought james brown was a black man.  you know, the name, the daily candy review stating that he specializes in kinky/curly textures.  i had assumptions -- and you know what happens when one assumes.

so, imagine my surprise when  -- afro and all -- i walked into his lovely salon on pine street.  i was nervous, people.  i know stylists are professionals and can usually handle all hair types, but, let me repeat, i have an afro.  a certain skill set is required to ensure the cooperation of my tresses.

well, james set me straight!  no pun intended.  i wanted a blow out for a little change of pace.  i was the only client at first, so i got lots of personal attention.  his assistant gave me a great shampoo, and then james got to work.  he uses great products and he is fast!  just the right amount of conversation, too

he recommended that i get a haircut for better shape.  i was nervous (i hadn't had my hair cut in a while and this was my first visit), but went for it.  i am glad i took his advice.  i was very pleased with the results -- and he did NOT charge extra for the cut.  

all in all, i was in and out of the salon in about one hour.  pretty amazing.  did i say i have an afro?  prompt and quick service.  he got my hair bone straight and it felt really healthy.  i was bouncing all of the way home.  that is . . . until it started raining!  :-(

i would go back again if i were in the mood to temporarily straighten my hair.  another plus: you can schedule your appointment online, so it is very convenient.

I was hungry so I ordered an extra pancake, thinking they were going to be the size of the ones at McDonald's.  Boy, was I wrong!

I thought about giving four stars because the coffee was so-so.  But, I know I'm a picky coffee drinker and the awesome water view made up for it so this restaurant deserves five stars!

Once I was on my own I didn't return for any particular reason. I always liked it and remember the food being very good with a decent atmosphere too. 

After a very long hiatus, I decided on whim to return with my own family. The atmosphere was still good, although the place was slightly worn around the edges in a good way. That's to be expected after almost a quarter of a century. It's a casual family place, not a fine dining establishment.

The food was still very good, maybe not quite up to par with what I remembered, but I don't know if that is just an artifact of memory or actual reality. We were served with only one bowl of tortilla chips with no refills offered. I don't know if refills cost extra, or if it was just laxness on our server's part. The chips were fresh and decent, but some weren't warm. The salsa was very good. I ordered the #17 combination plate, in which I had a red chili chimichanga along with refried beans and rice. The red chili had tender cubes of beef in a savory red chili sauce. At some Mexican restaurants the red chili sauce has a somewhat bland taste marred with a texture that is too thick presumably due to too much flour as a thickening agent. Not a Micha's as the sauce had just the right amount of thickness. Going overboard with red chili sauce, I ordered my chimi enchilada style, and it was very good and covered with melted cheddar cheese. The chimi itself was perfectly crisp on the outside with more of a non-fried flour tortilla texture on the inside, which is good but slightly different than the usual chimichangas in the area as they are more crispy throughout the tortilla wrapping. The refried bean were very flavorful and covered with melted cheese also. The rice was tasty, but it lukewarm and had a few cold clumps in it, so I would only say it was only fair. My wife had a carne asada burrito. It was good, but it was pretty dry and lacked the amount of onions and tomatoes that other places typically have. To counteract the dryness she ordered a side of guacamole, which also was a little atypical. The guacamole had a lot of onions, but the unusual part was that it also had some cottage cheese mixed in. Unusual, but good. One of my sons got a bean chimichanga, which was like mine in that it was crispy on the outside, but less so than other places on the inside. He liked it a lot. My other son ordered a machaca taco, chicken enchilada and rice. His plate looked good, and he said it was great. 

The service was good but not great. Our server was for the most part all business and not overly friendly. The bus boy was very friendly, however.

I would go back again. My kids loved it, and I thought it was good, but my wife was only partially impressed. So it won't be a place that we would frequent with any regularity, but I wouldn't hesitate to go again",2013-08-15 17:36:54,-0.19819649,0.07860546,-0.13498239

Service is always good as well. I've never had to wait for a table for a check. Food and drinks always come out quickly.

My biggest dislike of this place is the interior. On the outside, you have all these cute little sugar skulls. On the street corner there is a sign advertising the place with a picture of a comforting looking breakfast. You'd expect something kind of quirky or similar inside. But instead it's all just.... Blue. Blue paint everywhere. With hardly a decoration on the wall. It just makes the eating-out experience less of an experience. Blue is certainly my favorite color but the place just feels very uninviting.

I would recommend Mother Hubbard's do a little interior decorating to give this place more of a ""feel"". Disregarding the interior, I'd give this place 4 stars.

We visited Tampa Bay recently and due to the reviews on multiple websites we decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt.  Here is a rundown of my experience:

- Staff:   The staff is hands down the best staff I have ever encountered.  My wife and I are not high rollers and we were not there for business, yet were treated as such.  Due to the fact that we were there during a Tropical Storm, we got to know the bartenders (especially AJ and Alyssa) quite well and they treated us as family.  We had discussions about everything from their jobs to their families.  We even got a chance to talk to the Assistant Manager on the last day and tell her about our positive experience.  Later on that night, she sent us a handwritten card, free snacks, and a free movie pass.  This staff actually cares about you and your experience.  Absolutely fantastic 5 out of 5 stars.

- Hotel Grounds:   The grounds are beautiful and actually contain a nature trail.  It is right next to the airport, but you would not know it staying there.  They have a shuttle to and from the airport which is free to the guests.  They also have staff that will drive you anywhere on the resort for free in a golf cart, which is pretty awesome.  Unfortunately due to the tropical storm we did not get the opportunity to experience the entire resort.  We used the pool on the resort side which was clean with a nice small bar.  When the bar is not staffed they have a waiter that will come and serve you.  The rooms are very clean and modern.  I recommend getting a water view which looks out on Tampa Bay.  

- Food:   We ate only at the lobby bar (1823 Lounge) and Oystercatchers.  We had the Sunday brunch at Oystercatchers which was fantastic and had dinner there one night.  It is a little pricier but worth it not only for the food but for the beautiful views.  1823 Lounge also has a solid brunch and really good bar food.  We ate there multiple times and had no complaints.

All in all this was a great experience.  The next time we go to Tampa we will definitely stay at the Grand Hyatt.",2016-06-11 22:47:03,-1.1313803,0.7418425,-0.5833474

Denny was our delightful server. He explained the Groupon, i.e., there are three components: appetizer to share, beverages and entrees. So each has a dollar limit. All were generous.

We got the crab beignets (jumbo lump crab and fontina cheese in puff pastry) served with poblano aioli. The beignets were OK. The aioli had too much bite for me and had a taste of bitter horseradish (And I like horseradish.), so I just skipped that aioli. I would not repeat the beignets.

For entrees, my dining partner got the Pappardelle (grilled tenderloin with wild mushrooms in a port wine demi cream with goat cheese and radicchio). She ordered the tenderloin to her cook level and asked for the radicchio on the side.

I got the veal shank (16 ounces in pan juice served on wild mushroom polenta with a side of grilled vegetables).

First of all, I needed to understand what my dining partner ordered. I couldn't even pronounce it. She said it was like beef and noodles. OK, I can work with that.

Crap in a handbag, when those entrees came out, we were both in meat heaven. Such generous portions. Such beautiful food. OK. Got that down. How does it taste?

I've never had a veal shank, just thought it would be time to do that before I get dentures. Sumptuous meat flavor, tender, juicy, delicious. The wild mushroom polenta was underneath absorbing all that rich and tasty pan juice. It was spectacularly creamy with wonderful Earthy mushroom flavor.

The grilled vegetables were winter squash, zucchini, onion and tomatoes. They were so good and fresh, grilled beautifully. Nicely seasoned.

Dining partner's Pappardelle looked absolutely fabulous and enough to serve a third-world country. I don't know what the noodles were (this is listed as a pasta dish), but they were hearty and stood up well to the tenderloin. She loved it!

We also got their crazy bread basket that makes carbs grow on your eyelids. Pretzel rolls!! So irresistible. What we did not eat, I took home.

This was a true dining experience. Very different from the lunch I've had here previously, but circumstances need to be considered.

We both had hefty to-go vessels. And it was a lovely evening of catching up with my college chum and her daughter's up-coming wedding.

I'd repeat this in a New York second.

As a do-it-yourself kind of guy I like to do all the maintenance on my own vehicles. When I need to buy parts I frequently find myself at this Pep Boys. 

While they usually have whatever part I'm looking for, I would advise caution when getting parts from behind the counter. On too many occasions I've opened the box to find the wrong size parts. This usually causes the person behind the counter confusion only to then realize that some cars have different size parts depending on the model. I find this to be most often the case when I am buying brakes, rotors, or brake shoes.

Also, their prices are not always the best. Many times Autozone or Napa will have the same parts at a cheaper price. Sometimes Autozone or Napa will have a brand name on sale cheaper than the Pep Boys store brand. So shop around before you buy!",2014-10-29 18:13:46,-2.2076652,-0.4381881,0.5310853

This location had a fantastic cover band playing Saturday night (IPD - check them out, they were really amazing).  I drank and danced my fool ass off.  The crowd was really friendly (may have been my new jeans, or my drunken dance floor gyrations, but still).
We sat at the outside patio bar for a while - I always forget that people smoke cigarettes in other states so that took a little getting used to.  Our bartenders remained attentive the whole time we sat there ringing up a $130 tab.  And that's just what we spent outside before going inside to dance and drink some more!!!  My drinks were only $4.50 or $5 a pop, apparently depending on whether or not you pay with cash or credit, or maybe it depends on the bartender that charges you.  Hard to tell.  In any case, I take very little responsibility for wracking up that bar tab.  And when friends insist that you take shot after wretched shot, it only makes sense that they buy the damn things, so there.  Be prepared to severely damage your hearing if you decide to head inside for the band.  I really doubt such a tiny place needs such a wickedly huge sound system, especially when the dance floor is the same space where the band plays, sandwiched between the door and the bar.
Outside bar tab = $130 before tip
Inside bar tab = $100(ish) before tip

My boyfriend and I live just around the corner, but this was our first time at Zeppoli. Our menu for the evening included:

- antipasto siciliano for 2
- small portion of tagliatelli al limone
- small portion of pesto trapanese
- bistecca enna (rib-eye steak)
- pesce spada alla griglia (swordfish)
- zeppoli siciliano

Everything we had was simply delicious. All the veggies in the antipasto were fresh and the portion is generous. When faced with a plate full of roasted carrots, stuffed hot peppers, fried cauliflower, sopressata, fresh cheeses and grilled calamari, we wouldn't think that the arugula - which is really no more than a garnish - would be one of the best things we'd eat all night. The lemon fennel vinaigrette was out of this world. 

I will say that I found the tagliatelli al limone to be ever so slightly on the oily side, but still better than average. However, one bite of the rib-eye and all else was forgotten. Everything we ate last night was delicious, but the rib-eye was definitely the star of the evening. I don't know what seasonings they use, but the buttery, smokey, charred flavor that hits your mouth is amazing. 

I could go on and on about every bite we had, but what blew me away more than anything (aside from the arugula) was the service. Possibly the best service I have ever had. Our waiter, Thomas, was so polite, knowledgeable and friendly. The personalized service and attention made us feel like we were the only patrons in the restaurant.

At the risk of fawning over this place, I have to say that my high expectations were exceeded. Of course, this caliber of service and food comes at a price. I've always wanted a neighborhood restaurant or bar where people actually knew my name - if Zeppoli was just slightly cheaper, this would be the place for me. That said, the quality of the food and service certainly justifies the price.",2012-05-04 14:27:00,0.7076657,-0.34933618,-0.16488405

I'm not sure if all locations are the same , but the spice isle at this particular store was 2 feet wide and three shelves high.   They probably had 10-12 different spices in all and many were basic and useless .    Though the prices were rather low, I thought for a minute that I may have missed the ACTUAL spice isle and that this was perhaps a display shelf.

I traversed the entire market in search of some help to either aid me in locating the true spice isle or to assure me that their meager 10 jar shelf was the best they had to offer.    No luck.  I may have laid eyes on one or two employees but none were too concerned with making so much as eye contact w me let alone offer any help whatsoever.

Now I would be a whole lot more understanding if they store was super busy or it was the day before thanksgiving or something.   But this was just a lazy Saturday morning.....maybe 20 patrons in the entire place.  Just nothing to purchase and no one to convince me otherwise .   

So I dropped my basket on the floor and left.  Went to Albertsons where their spice isle was 20 - 30 feet long with hundreds of options from which to choose.  

I got every spice I was looking for in five minutes.   Many were 2 for $3.

Once I got around to the back of the store buy the beer, wine and dried goods I started to smell the stench of cigarettes. At first I was willing to write this off as maybe a door was open by the loading dock. But then I walked by the office with the door wide open and two people smoking openly. I choose to ask them why they were smoking in the building and all they could do was write it off as ""smoking in the office"" and ""yeah it's a dirty habit"".

Simply put, we were very happy with almost everything about this hotel.  Its location cannot be beat -- just across the street from the French Quarter proper, on a major bus line, and about  a 7-minute walk to the heart of Bourbon Street.  Our room faced Rampart Street and we never had a problem with street noise.  Right next door, there's a gas station with a convenience store with a pretty good deli -- got a great chicken po boy there.  Our two-bedroom suite was like our own apartment (with a small fridge but no kitchen), and everything worked properly, and the place was clean and in good repair.  You can access the HDMI ports of the HDTV if you want to plug in a device. The wi-fi worked well for us the whole time -- watched a few TV shows on Netflix without any problems.  There are two pools which are kept a very nice temperature.  The back pool seemed a bit sketchy, but the main pool in their lovely courtyard is an oasis.  The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful, going out of their way to get us things like towels, and Dennis even sent us a text message the night before we left offering to assist us with reserving a cab the next morning.  It was also a great value -- less than $150 a night for a two-bedroom suite, a figure that includes taxes and fees.  The only complaint was that the continental breakfast was exceedingly weak, with a very small number of oddly chosen foods -- the menu consisted of sliced tomatoes, sliced cheese, sliced oranges and sliced grapefruit,and bread but no pastries, no apples or bananas -- and drinks were limited to coffee, water, and Sunny Delight.  The do-it-yourself waffles were a nice touch.  But this was truly a minor complaint, as any visitor to New Orleans should never eat breakfast -- only brunch -- and never in a hotel when there are so many other great dining options.  Overall, we were incredibly happy with our decision to stay here, and it's now the first spot I'll consider on a return visit.

I was very excited to give a new city a try, and St. Louis had a lot going for it, minus one major aspect-yup, you guessed it, FROYO!!! Born and raised in L.A., I am extremely spoiled in the froyo department. Pinkberry-check, old school 80's froyo joints, check (how it all started!). Basically any type of froyo-old and new-was at my fingertips. Now along with giving up my family, friends, and spacious bedroom, I was giving up my daily (yes, daily) froyo fix.

Of course I did some serious recon before migrating eastward, and was not too optimistic about the results. I discovered the Midwest's version of froyo was the historic treat called frozen custard, and in St. Louis, specifically from Ted Drewes. According to handy Wikipedia, frozen custard is a cold dessert similar to ice cream, made with eggs in addition to cream and sugar. It typically contains 10% butterfat and 1.4% egg yolk. I unfortunately never got the blessed opportunity to try fresh frozen custard, but I did sample some in a pre-packed container after Wash U's opening ceremony. I tried the vanilla, sans toppings (but according to their websites they have flavors ranging from Tart Cherry to Pistachio, and a concoction called a concrete, for which they blend in toppings and custard and freeze the mixture).

The vanilla was good (albeit quite caloric), but not stellar in my eyes. I hear some Midwesterners swear by it, but I guess it's just not my style (I'm more of a classic 80's froyo girl-think Penguins or Golden Spoon-esque). But then again, it was very creamy and dense, and I do highly encourage you guys to try it fresh from the stand if you every find yourselves in the STL.

The poppers were tasty, not too spicy but the flavor was good..they came with a tomato/marinara sauce. The pizza was absolutely delicious. I have a minor issue that they probably forgot to add salt to our pizza (I usually very less salt in my food so it was strange that I found it low).

Food. I ordered the Shitaki and Gouda burger with onion straws. It was lacking in mositness and flavor but it was not awful. What saved this meal were the sweet potato fries. They were killer. What killed it was the fact that the order was wrong and I got the wrong fries. The redemption was I tried the regular fries and they were also amazing. 
Beer. I chose to do the 1.75 5 ounce samplers versus the larger beers seeing as I was not sure what I would like. First sample was the raspberry cider. Very sweet, nice good flavor. Not something I could drink more than a 5 ounce sampler but would do again. I also had a Pilsner, the name slips me, it was VERY good. I am a beer wimp and I really enjoyed the flavor.
Service. YIKES. Terrible, awful bad. Appetizers never came. Beers came sporadically. Order was wrong and server threw the kitchen under the bus.

There were some kinks but not anything I would complain about. After all, our group had 8 people so it was understandable. Second time was probably a month later and I noticed they figured out some of the kinks. Their servers are nice and I genuinely felt like they wanted to make my experience great. I know this because every time I made a request the waiter would literally run to get it. I've never seen a server so dedicated, kudos! Honestly most of the stars I'm giving them is because of their genuine service. Added bonus, they were playing Star Trek, hunger games, and iron man. Nice movie selections haha.

The seafood was ok. It's not their fault; it's Tucson so you know you really can't get fresh seafood. That's why I took off a star. They have 1 type of sauce with mild, medium, hot spiciness. It's similar to angry crab's ""trifecta"" or boiling crab's, ""the whole shabang"" but with an Asian twist. It was good in my opinion.

Lastly, if anyone has ever gone to angry crab, hot n juicy, boiling crab, should know that the price range is similar. Heck, if anyone has ever bought raw seafood at the store should know that it is on the expensive side. Expensive? Yes. Overpriced? No. I have been to many seafood places similar to this and it's a decent price for what you get. My advice for the Dungeness crab, since it did happen to me at other places and I saw a review on it here, is to share it or get their other selections that they can measure out. The dungeness crab is a full crab so finding a 1 lb dungeness crab is not common.

The scallop and risotto was just ok, I was expecting a better dish and I'd give it a 6/10.

I have had bad experience after bad experience at this pharmacy.  First, they are incredibly slow.  There's often a long line of cars at the drive through window.  Even when there are no customers at the pharmacy counter inside, they seem to take a break between cars, making everyone wait for no reason whatsoever.

Recently, I went to pick up a prescription I have been taking for years.  After I paid, but before she handed me my medicine, the woman told me I had to wait and talk to the pharmacist.  I explained that I had the flu and that I had been taking that medication at that dosage for years and I really didn't want to wait for the pharmacist.  I just wanted to get home before I threw up again.  She told me it would be illegal for her to give me the medicine without talking to the pharmacist.  That is a bold faced lie.  It may violate Walgreens's policy, but it is not illegal.  Ask an attorney or any non-Walgreens pharmacy.

Finally, I was prescribed two medicines that cannot be taken together.  This Walgreens filled both prescriptions, repeatedly.  When I found out about the potentially deadly interaction between the two medicines, I pointed it out to the pharmacist very politely.  First, he had no idea those medicines were contraindicated.  Second, he acted like it was no big deal at all.  He never said sorry or we'll look into it or anything.  He just said something like, ""So you want me to take X medication off automatic refill?""

I chose a buffalo blue burger off their specialty menu. You're asked how you want your burger cooked, which usually makes me nervous. If an establishment asks for temp preference, they had better nail it. Lucky for me, my burger came out perfectly medium and my fellow diners were also pleased with their orders. 

The first thing that impressed me about the burger was the SLAB of blue cheese sitting atop the sizeable, mouthwatering patty and the nice drizzle of buffalo sauce encompassing everything. No blue cheese crumbles here - this cheese chunk was like a deck of cards in size! No complaints from me about this burger!

I snuck a few fries from my friends - truffle fries were nice and light and crispy. Sweet potato fries were also good. 

The only downside of this place is the cluttered and small seating area. We went during lunch rush on a Friday so this is to be expected in any center city spots, but the large wooden high tops and stools were laid out in a really inefficient patten. It was like a game of Jenga to try to work yourself into a seat (which luckily we found). 

Burgers are around $9. Price with a drink and fries was about $15.

Verdict: I would definitely return.",2015-12-06 23:47:16,0.28957754,-0.58111656,0.15572499

The second I walked in the door I was told not to touch anything (before I even tried) before I was even greeted.

When my friend tried to make an offering to the altar, he was told to leave it at the register and they would place it for him. They operate this place as though they take the practice seriously, ok fine, but don't be rude. An offering is personal, if we can't place it, fine, but give it to someone else to place? No. And as far as not being able to touch anything because the wares sold are used on altars, two things: first, if I want to buy a piece, I want to hold it and see if it speaks to me. Second, I definitely don't want the rude employees' bad vibes all over it. No thanks. I'll go to Marie's. Way nicer staff and way friendlier vibe.

I hadn't thought too much about it, but when I walked in, I realized the Saturday before Thanksgiving probably wasn't the best day to go to Hobby Lobby. The lines went halfway back into the store and I could have cried. But it's a colossal pain in the neck for me to get to any Hobby Lobby in the Nashville area, so stick it out I would. I finished my shopping and went to stand in line, expecting to get fully caught up on all of the emails I was behind on. Check out at Hobby Lobby is a slow process, because they haven't made it to the 21st century and computers yet. I know this because I had the unenviable job of Hobby Lobby cashier in high school (admittedly that was many, many years ago). ""No ma'am, I cannot scan the bar code to get the price. Why, you ask? Well, because I'm using the same registers my grandfather had in his hardware store a generation and a half ago."" But I digress. 

It was 12:10 when I got in line. There were maybe four people ahead of me and it only took a few minutes for two of them to be processed out. When I looked up from my email backlog and realized how far I'd moved up in the line, I was kind of taken aback. Then a cashier came over to me and asked if I was just checking out or if I had any returns. Having no returns or exchanges, she said she was able to check me out at the next register. I went to her register, got rung up, took my buggy to my car, unloaded everything into my car, took the buggy back to the store, went back to my car, and looked at my phone. 12:20. It took only ten minutes for me to wait in line and get checked out at mid-day on a Saturday during the holiday season. This so incredibly amazing! I'm not sure what kind of sorcery they have going on at this store, but this is most definitely the only Hobby Lobby I'm going to from now on!

We paid in advance online and arrived late in the evening to check-in, the parking lot was packed, we drove around for quite some time to find a space and then walked a short distance to the front doors of the hotel and the lobby was packed! Music playing, people seated at the bar, playing pool and just sort-of hanging out. We were extremely exhausted after driving in from New Jersey. After attending a funeral, repass at the church and then again at the home of the family, it was quite a long day and we were a bit hungry and tired.   

We checked in, paid $10.00 for parking (which I'll talk more about shortly) and asked if they had room service, which they do not and we were given a menu of a place that delivered. We took the elevator to our floor and as soon as we stepped off the elevator we were greeted with dog poop on the floor. As we walked down the hall to our room, we were greeted with the smell of weed, pot, Mary Jane, marijuana or whatever you want to call it. We got into our room and called the front desk and advised them of the dog poop and then placed an order with Femi's pizza for delivery. 

My boyfriend then went down to the hotel bar to grab a drink, as he sat down at the bar there was a woman and man seated beside him and he could hear their entire conversation, the young woman was telling the gentleman her cost for SERVICES, yes, those services! My boyfriend took a few sips of his drink and got up to come back to our room, he was then approached by THREE women who asked him if they could go back to his room with him, he said no thank you, and that he had a girlfriend upstairs that he was going back to, and they said, ""too bad, you could have had some fun tonight"" 

Once back safely our room the food delivery called to say that the hotel would not let me up and that we needed to come down to pick up our food. We ate and went right to sleep. The next morning we woke to the sounds of planes departing and arriving, we showered, dressed and checked out of the hotel. 

As I mentioned earlier, I would tell you about parking. We paid the additional $10.00 for parking as parking was not included. We got to the gate to slide in our paid parking pass and the gate was GONE, their was nothing there and we just drove away and headed back to New Jersey. 

The hotel and rooms are quite trendy, the shower was nice and the complimentary body wash and 2 in1 shampoo and conditioner were nice. However, there was a bit of a sour smell coming from the drain, the bed was pretty basic, I would not want to sleep on it more that one night. The wall unit a/c turned on and off all night, I tried to adjust the temp on the unit itself and it would not adjust.

I'll start out with the good.  The atmosphere and service were fantastic.  The person who took my order was friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is spacious and clean.  She suggested the rooster sauce for my fries and I had no complaints about the fries or sauce.  Unfortunately, my burger experience was not so great.  Keep in mind the fact that I was hung over and hadn't eaten since the previous night, so a Big Mac would have been delicious to me.  I ordered the $12 ground lamb burger and was highly anticipating it's lamby goodness.  When the burger arrived, it came with a homemade pickle (good) and homemade ketchup (fantastic).  Now, when I order a burger at an upscale (ish) burger restaurant, I don't expect the burger to be large.   However, I do expect an appropriate bun size that doesn't totally overpower the rest of the sandwich.  In this case, the homemade bun was dry and far too thick for the not-so-well-endowed burger patty.  I ended up taking the top half of the bun and eating the burger like that and it was better.

All that said, the sides, shakes and atmosphere were enough to make me lean positive in spite of the burger, but barely.  I would be debating 4 or 5 stars if the burger was fantastic.  Unfortunately it wasn't, and considering burgers are the main draw here, the best rating I can give is an unenthusiastic 3 stars.",2012-02-04 19:45:29,0.22646753,-1.0221077,-0.07948095

The bars had an outlet which was handy. I got bulgogi bibimbab and miso soup came with my order. There is only one size, but it definitely fills you up. Like a traditional Korean bibimbab, there are plenty of veggies and rice. The type of meat is your choice. You don't even have to get meat. On the side, there are a few condiments. As a Korean, of course I got the spicy red pepper sauce. But I think it was mixed with something else because it didn't taste like a regular . It wasn't spicy really... more watered down taste and a little sweet. It was weird. Not what I was expecting. 

We had to try out the dessert! It's supposed to be this traditional Korean bingsoo, but it wasnt. The traditional Korean bingsoo does not have whip cream on it... they also mixed the red bean and condensed milk together. So when we asked for extra condensed milk, they just gave us more red bean. They also forgot to put milk in our dessert bowl. The ice was hard and chunky. I was chewing on ice most of the time. I hated it. The dessert is horrible. Highly do not recommend. 

You can tell Bab Cafe is Americanized and not a traditional Korean place. First thing is the music. They play American music at a Korean cafe. I love American music don't get me wrong, but it's a Korean place. You should place Korean music. Second, they charge you for kimchi!!! Korean places usually get FREE side dishes. That's how we Koreans eat!! I couldn't believe they charged for kimchi. Third, the dessert. The whip cream has got to go! The ice wasn't shaved enough, I guess you can say.

We knew to bring a rag, which you definitely want to be able to wipe your hands off, however, we bought the gloves, which were unneccessary.

The hotel sits right in the heart of the French Quarter and is within easy walking distance to all of the tourist sites and other notable locations within the city. The hotel does offer a continental breakfast that is not bad for what it is. Its pretty much the standard fare of eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, potatoes or grits depending on the day. They also have a wide selection of other breakfast items should you not like the hot food choices. The rooms are elegant and cozy but are a little on the small side which is fine. I also greatly appreciated that the floors were marble or some facsimile which meant you did not have to worry about what may be living in the carpet of the room. It is a decent place to stay but I think the negatives do out weigh the positives. 
So what are the negatives. First off if you have a rental car you will need to pay a huge fee of $36 dollars a day in order to have it parked for you. It is true that the hotel is very good about getting the car for you when you need it and then parking it again when you are done. Where the shock with the parking comes from the fact that you are charged a tax on each of those days that it has been parked so in reality the parking of the care is not $36 but $40 dollars a day. This is something that really needs to be placed on their website so that people know. The second really bad thing was the housekeeping. We came bake early one of the days and the room was not completed so the housekeeper asked us if we could wait. We said it was no problem at all and for her to take her time. Well she made up the room but took a huge shortcut on making the bed. The bed has a duvet on it and instead of putting the duvet in a cover she just wrapped it in two sheets. So we had they nasty duvet touching our skin because she neglected to give us a sheet to use to cover our selves. We also noted that the headboard seems to never get dusted or cleaned as we found some disgusting stuff on top of it. The alarm clock in the room is very dated and while it is mentioned that you can use an IPod for your alarm that will only work if you have the older version of the IPod. It is not able to use the newer ones. The last thing that really upset us is that we booked our vacation on Travelocity as a package so we know that the room was at a discounted rate. We felt like we were penalized for this because we were placed in this back area that seemed like it was empty except for us and we had to walk up and down 25 stairs to get to and from our room. It was not until the weekend that we noticed others that were also placed in the back area with us and one guest was so upset with the bedding that they threw it outside their room. 

All in all it was an okay hotel but not one that I would check into again.",2016-10-01 04:58:49,0.4370813,0.81650376,-0.4731416

They take at least 3 to 4 weeks to send out a prescription, so we are always in the position of paying ridiculously expensive expedited shipment charges.  Furthermore, I have NEVER received my sleeping pill from them even though they say they have mailed it.  I believe someone within Express Scripts steals controlled substances.

Our latest debacle with this company is that they told us we could no longer fill our prescriptions at Kroger, that Kroger was no longer in our plan.  I contacted our company and this is not true.  I called Express Scripts again and spoke with a different customer service rep who said that Kroger is in our plan, but if we use them instead of using Walgreen's or Express Scripts, we will incur a severe penalty.

I insisted on speaking with a supervisor.  I told the supervisor I wanted a cost analysis of the cost to us of filling our prescriptions as Kroger versus Walgreen's.  I already knew that every one of our prescriptions is cheaper at Kroger than at Walgreen's.  At that point, the supervisor acquiesced and admitted that we could use Kroger without any penalty.  

Obviously, Express Scripts makes a greater profit if the customer uses Walgreen's or Express Scripts instead of Kroger.  The supervisor denied that his underlings were told to try to make customers use the retail outlets that are more profitable to Express Scripts, but I don't believe it.  I told him the problem is one of the following:  1) Employees are told to shift customers to retail outlets that are more profitable for Express Scripts, which is dishonest; or 2) The employees of Express Scripts are very poorly trained and don't understand the prescription policies they enforce.  Either explanation is a bad reflection on Express Scripts.

The bad: It seems as if NHA is overwhelmed by the sheer volume of animals they have. When I adopted my kitten, I was told she was an 11 week old male. In fact, she was an 8 week old female, and had been spayed around 5-6 weeks of age. 

I had my baby for about 2 months before she was diagnosed with effusive FIP. My options were to put her out of her misery or let her slowly suffocate from the fluid building up in her chest cavity. 

Most cats in shelters are exposed to the coronavirus that mutates into FIP in a small percentage of cats. My vet theorized that the combination of coming from a shelter and being spayed so young (can weaken a kitty's immune system) made my little one more susceptible to the viral mutation that leads to FIP. 

Although I want to love NHA for the good work they are doing and the good people that work there, the complete lack of information about the animals up for adoption is a huge red flag for me.

I have been waiting for some time to try this restaurant out, and due to it being recently named Edmonton's Best New Restauarant of 2015 by Avenue Magazine, I was expecting long line ups.  However, we had no troubles being seated quickly on a Tuesday evening.

I really like how the space in the Mercer Tavern has been remodeled and decorated.  The waiting area is especially cool with tv's featuring old Mexican shows.  The hostess, servers and bartenders are all chatty, friendly, helpful and seem to really enjoy their jobs.

First, this place is local to me. It's located in the Tower Grove South neighborhood in a nondescript building. They have free wifi and ample plugins for electronics... Which would have been handy had I ate in as my Macbook's battery is exhausted these days.

If you can't bring yourself over there or feel comfy in your PJs, no fear! There is delivery available through the bike waiter for $2.99 (or through Eat24 - who uses the bike waiter, but offers a weekend coupon)

They offer breakfast and lunch, but all I have had is breakfast. What have I had?

French Toast sticks... I feel like I was told there would only be three pieces, but I got four... Not those wimpy French today sticks from the freezer aisle, but actually French toast cut into strips. They come with the best syrup ever. 

Triple Quasar burrito. I uploaded a pic of this and it really was huge. Huge doesn't always translate into tasty with burritos, but this one was great.

Originally, we were attracted to this hotel because the rooms on the app were advertised with balcony rooms. However, after further research (post booking) we learned that not all rooms here have balconies. To us, the balcony was important because of all the festivities that would be happening below, on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway - what a great birds eye view, even if the Embassy suites would obstruct the view of the main event, the fireworks over the art museum - we wanted to feel as though we were outside without being in the crowd. Prior to checking in, the people at the hotel informed me that rooms were assigned at check-in and they couldn't promise anything until the day of. So, I arrived very early to the hotel to try and arrange something, however the attendants at the front desk are very strange in their techniques of ""best accommodating guests"" 

I was told that no balcony rooms would be available nor would any become available throughout the day. Even after I offered to pay for an upgrade, I was assured that they were booked to capacity. But when I overheard another attendant speaking to the guest next to me offer multiple rooms with balconies (and give options as to which room they wanted), I decided to confront my attendant about their availability. She walked away for a while and after several minutes she was magically able to ""switch a few things around"" and make it work. But for a price, I paid $100 extra for a room with a balcony - which ended up actually being a great room and kind of worth the money....but not the hassle, haggle and confusion it took to get it in the first place. I came in person to make these arrangements at 11am and was told that my room would be ready closer to check in (3pm) but I would receive a call when the room was good to go...and of course, I never received a call. I actually ended up calling the hotel around 4pm to inquire about the status of the room and that's when I was informed it was ready. Also, they force valet parking on you as if it's mandatory (30-something odd dollars a night), but there's literally a parking garage with $5 evening parking, out by 9AM right around the corner and probably many other garages within walking distance and street/metered parking available close by. 

Besides bargaining with the front desk, everything else about the hotel is actually pretty nice. I have also previously stayed here a few years ago and since then, they've changed the look of their lobby completely...the lobby is almost unrecognizable, but they're still undergoing construction. The rooms are very spacious and the kitchenette comes in handy! I wish I could've cancelled my reservation though, but due to booking through a third party, this wasn't an option. And I'm highly aware that booking through a third party leaves the room assignments to the hotels discretion, but I didn't like feeling mistreated because of the means by which I booked my room. Regardless of whether I booked directly through the hotel, Expedia, Priceline, Orbitz, Hotel Tonight or whatever medium, essentially, I am still a guest of the Windsor Suites and expect to be treated that way.",2015-07-05 09:09:28,-1.228624,0.44206855,-0.9980372

It was 10am on a Thursday and they were training someone so it took a bit for someone to take my order.  I ordered 2 donuts and an iced vanilla chai latte.   Apparently it comes frozen not on ice.  This was not explained to me.  I would not have ordered it if I had known.  The person was rude and didn't understand my complaint just said there is crushed ice in it.  So frustrating. Was not good.   Wouldn't order any coffee drinks here.   I got to my car to take a drink and it leaked out all over my off white suit shirt.  I will not be going to this store ever again.

We started off w a few drinks- Mezcal, apple brandy, honey and lemon (forget the name), the lil hillbilly which is a watermelon white whiskey drink and a flight of the Rittenhouse rye brewed right in Rittenhouse. They were all delicious. After that we got right to it!  Started off with the smoked ricotta tomato salad. The ricotta literally melts in your mouth. Amazing!  The next two dishes came out in a piping hot skillet, the cornbread and sweet potato casserole. Both equally delicious. Next up, the shrimp and grits which turned my non grits liking boyfriend into a fan haha so so good!  The pulled pork w grilled peaches was also very good, but finally the hot chicken made its grand entrance and holy hell I could eat this dish every single day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The perfectly spiced chicken sits atop a piece of toast smothered in a buttermilk ranch dressing w pickles. My dream come true on a plate and my fav dish of the night. We also can't forget about the homemade hot sauce that sits on every table. I love hot sauce and don't get me wrong, this hot sauce is the bomb, but I found myself not wanting to use it bc the food was just that good. 

Finally, we had dessert. I called ahead and told them it was my boyfriends bday so they surprised him w the Mississippi mud pie and I of course had to try the red velvet cake. I mean everybody needs cake on their birthday, right?!

But Chinese delight is different.  We've gotten delivery as well as eat-in.  I can't really make any comment about price or delivery time, as the bf usually pays and the group is too busy hanging out and gaming to notice the time.  But the food always satisfies.  The spring rolls are delicious.  The lo mein is my favorite.  The spicey food is spicey, and the non-spicey food is still delicious.

When we ate in the restaurant it was a pleasant experience.  Instead of bread or chips like other restaurants give you, here they give you a bowl of won-ton noodles (those tasty chip things) and two of us wiped out two bowls flat before our food came.  OMG I could eat my weight in those noodles if left to my own devices....

Sure, there's always a language barrier at Chinese restaurants, but I found the people to be friendly, regardless.  I noticed the owner went over to one of the other tables and started passing around a picture of her grandson or something.  Pretty funny, if you ask me.  My bf and his friends have been regulars there for years so the people at the restaurant know them by name and face.  When we all ate there once it was like a big family reunion, everyone was joking with each other - but mostly because we were the only people in there.  When it was just me and the bf there was only one other table, but the phones were ringing off the hook (it was Sunday afternoon) and there was a steady, unrelenting flow of people for take-out.  The food came out fast, too, so I suspect that if you order for pick up it'll get there much faster than delivery, since the poor guy has probably like 5 stops each delivery!

Now that we're cooking our own food most of the time, when we do decide to order from Chinese Delight I'm always in for it.  For a take-out-and-delivery Chinese food place, it's top notch.  No, seriously.  If you want a fancy, romantic expensive Chinese restaurant, go to Margaret Kuo's.  But if you want some good Chinese take-out that will renew your love for easy Asian food (you know, the love that was crushed by the greasy, gross, nasty cheap Chinese food that you remember from all-nighters in college?), then give Chinese Delight a try.  If you like Chinese food AT ALL, you'll like this place.

My nails looked satisfactory but there was no care, none of the extra love that I'm used to (im originally from NY) put into my mani, pedi and eyebrows. 

While I was home visiting NY last month I put acrylic on my nails to give my natural nails a chance to grow underneath. I DONT usually do acrylic but I decided to try it. I came back to Philly to get my nails redone and the woman kept asking me if I wanted acrylic. After I repeatedly told her no, she wasn't getting the fact that I wanted the acrylic already on my nails to be removed. (I've also never experienced a problem with the language barrier here) Once she finally got that, she began to remove them with the buffer. I'm not sure if she didn't know what she was doing or if she used the wrong head size but she kept hurting my finger nails. Like sharp pains. She apologized and held my fingers but out of my months of coming here I had never experienced anything this bad.

You can tell Thai Place pays attention to the details. The decor, general presentation of food, and the fact the thai iced tea comes with a straw wrapper twisted into a cute origami :) Also, the staff are friendly, and the prices are reasonable, especially for the quality of food. 

The one concern I have about Thai food in general is the grease level. But the food at Thai Place has consistently been not greasy, even the fried foods, and quite flavorful. 

The last time we came here, we had fried taro root, vegetarian pad thai, and vegetarian green curry.  I'd recommend all those dishes.  The vegetarian pad thai was delicious. The vegetarian green curry was a bit spicy, but it came with a chock full of vegetables and tofu.",2013-02-23 19:19:58,0.6016032,-0.13814868,0.39971432

We were able to walk from our canal-side apt, mostly because we didn't want to pay the $28 garage fee. There are plenty of valets out front, someone to open the doors for you and any check in agents not busy at their station wait in front of the counter to greet you and bring you to their station.  Check in was easy and quick and the agent was very kind. After answering all my questions about check out times, restaurant hours, and fitness center and pool locations, she took me directly to the elevators. She proudly stated that there were 2 sets of elevators, with the high rise lifts being the ""fastest in the midwest"".  Between the concierge and elevators is the Lobby Lounge with a couple tall fire n ice type fireplaces and lots of comfy looking couches, tables, and bar tables. The lounge menu looks interesting and they even have a Soju cocktail! (that's a Korean rice liquor drink.) Specialty cocktails are $9.
We had requested a high level room and we got the 28th (out of 33) floor with a big picture window view over the end of the canal and the White River. We had a standard double bed with oh so comfy bed linens, a work desk with a cordless phone, flat screen Samsung TV and coffee maker. The shower had a large glass door and a rain type shower head as well as 2 smaller adjustable heads below it. Fun but you can't turn all the heads on at the same time.  We were very nicely greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries after we returned from dinner, which we finished off in our bathrobes.  There is an iPod docking stereo which we couldn't get to work, but we could hear directly from the iPhone pretty well anyway. 
The hotel and rooms are clean with a Vegas like feel. We looked around the fitness center, which is quite large and has lots of machine and small semiprivate areas for yoga/pilates/bosu. The indoor pool looked pretty small. Our room came with free breakfast at Osteria Pronto which has a sizable buffet for only $16. It would be a very nice stay in Indy for out of towners and I'd return to the bar and restaurant as a local.  I actually like the look of the building and think it makes downtown look more modern.

Our waitress was really really nice but that's where the good things I have to say end. Most of us ordered ramen and all of the noodles were super starchy, like how they are when over-cooked. It really was not enjoyable. I didn't complain because I don't really do that, but some of my friends did and were told that's how he noodles were supposed to taste. When two in my group tried to order something else, the waitress (who was so sweet) had to come back and tell one of them that the chef didn't want to make what she ordered (an item that was on the menu) because he was pushing a different combination of fish. That was ridiculous.

When I walked in, the ambience was pretty much what'd you expect for a Saturday night, with groups of friends sitting at tables and parties of 1-2 sitting at the bar. The wait was initially quoted as an hour, but someone finished up early and I only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. 

They had an interesting selection of beers and cocktails, but I wasn't thirsty so much as hungry so I passed on the drinks. The menu was very simple and straightforward, and I ordered the crab broth noodles and dumplings in chili oil. 

The dumplings in chili oil came first, there were 4 cute dumplings in a small bowl. They were very tasty, but were different than what I was expecting. Growing up in Asia, dumplings usually have higher fat content and are easier to chew, but I guess the meat in these dumplings were leaner and took a bit longer to chew through.

The crab broth noodles came shortly after, and I must say I was pretty disappointed. I passed over the miso ramen for these noodles, and the soup in this broth was a bit spicy and sour, but wasn't as brothy as they claimed. The hand-drawn noodles were quite tasty and bouncy, but to me they were ruined by the broth. 

Overall, I'd give the dumplings a 4, the noodles a 2.5, and the overall experience a 3.5. If I do come back next time, I'll try the miso ramen instead!",2014-11-02 18:40:09,0.34388155,-0.3044999,-1.4440976

The space is small and they do have dine in tables (but no liquor license if you're here for brunch...but they do have mixers I'm told if you bring your own).  The staff was courteous and prompt. 

But on to the important stuff. The $1 croissant bites are genius. They melt in your mouth with buttery deliciousness but still have a bit of a crunch on the edges. I hate a mushy croissant. I also tried the mixed berry and apple turnovers. They were perfectly sized and the mixed berry was clearly the winner being tart and not too sweet. The apple was good to but the berry was amazing.  As I'm not a coffee person I got a perfectly tasty iced tea and was out the door.

The one thing that is lacking is their signage. Maybe it's building rules or maybe they just haven't gotten there yet. But blink and you'l miss them. They are riverside on Magazine between General Pershing and Milan...so dangerously close to home.

So myself and three others stayed here for the past week. it is a great hotel it seems, and it is in a prime location on Bourbon Street. (in fact, it takes up teh whole 200 block)

Well designed, nice old school class. Tremendous lobby, great facilities, etc.. Beautiful Pool, Nice little garden area with Orange trees, etc.

If you are worried about noise, dont be. We were on the 5th floor,and could not hear a peep from Bourbon Street, even on a Saturday!

The Beds are comfortable, the rooms nice, and amenities everything you would want. 

I love the classy, old school feel in the lobby, with the message wall behind the front desk and more.


So if it was so comfortable, then why only the three stars?

Well, the first is the service. we had 3 incidents. Not 1,Not 2, but THREE (we stayed form Thursday - Thursday - 7 nights)

1. We got food on Saturday night. We called and asked for plates and flatware. They said "" sure,we will be right up"". They never showed. We called again. They still didnt show. No happy

2. Sunday- room cleaning never came. WE thought, maybe it was because of timing. We were up early to go to the Rock n Roll marathon, and got back around 1, and were in the room till 4. So we figured that maybe, we were in there when they came by... benefit of the doubt..

3. Tuesday - well, again. no house cleaning. But we left early int he morning. And came back in the afternoon. Not cleaned. SO when we left for dinner at 5, we went to the front desk to complain. They said they would have it cleaned so when we got back it would be all set.
Wel, we got back,and it still had not been cleaned. At least they brought us clean towels.

So three distinct service problems that soiled our opinion of an otherwise very nice hotel. It could have been great, t could have been the best, and it could have got me to come back more and more

But it seems they have luxury pretensions and decor without the service to match. I will have to think before staying there again, which is a disappointment.

I would not tell anyone to NOT look at it, but think of what you find important, and take it how you will

ps. twice during our stay the elevators were on the fritz as well. One was not working and the other was malfunctioning.

pps... if you want ot use the pool, and the temps are under 70 degrees, make sure to ask hours before. We were interested in going for a swim in the heated pool in 65 degree temps... but it wasnt on, and were told it would take 4-5 hours to get warmed up!",2013-02-28 22:00:45,-1.1206415,0.66413236,-0.9701014

There are hands on exhibits highlighting science, art and technology with similar exhibits as other museums in Northern CA, such as the Exploratorium in SF and tech museum in San Jose but in a smaller, less in depth scale. There's a nice rooftop play area (which is really sunny) with water play and musical instrument displays, as well as, view of the Santa Ynez mountains on one side and Pacific Ocean on the other side.  There is a short, 15-20 minute movie in the theater on the second floor which runs about every 30 min (schedule is posted there). We arrived at the opening time and the kids, 5 and 8 years old, played for about 2 hours. We may have been able to stretch it out for another hour but not the whole day. 

I did find myself wishing there were plaques with blurbs explaining the science behind some of the less self explanatory exhibits. There are several guides walking around offering help but they are not always there. For example, the Mind Ball exhibit. Two guides walking around gave variable responses about what was actually being measured (one talked about alpha waves and another just said a blank mind is better). Another example, the drum on the roof. It appears that you complete the circuit with your hands with the drum beat corresponding to your heart rate. 

I would recommend a hat for the roof as it is very sunny there, as well as, snacks (no cafe or snack bar). Check out the movie schedule on the second floor at or near the beginning of your visit if think you want to watch. We tried to go towards the end of our visit and didn't know where it was located, then got there when the auditorium was full. We left without watching the movie because we didn't want to wait.

First thing I noticed was how big and open the space is. High ceilings and windows that illuminate the entire space. Colors are neutral which feels comforting. Seating consists of cafe style bench seating with high backs along the far wall, high top communal tables towards the front center and then shorter individual tables elsewhere. Because of its size, seating doesn't feel cramped. Customer's were a mix of late Sunday brunchers, families, couples and friends. Our server (whose name I don't remember) was extremely nice and full of information and suggestions. Very enthusiastic! The menu isn't so overwhelming like a Cheesecake Factory menu, but with so many vegetarian/vegan options it makes deciding a challenge. They serve brunch until 4. Vegan meat substitutes include sausage and seitan. After much deliberation my husband and I both ordered the Veggie Philly Cheesestake. The sandwich is huge, layers of cheese, seitan, long hots and sautéed onions. They pair it with a sharp steak knife to cut into bite sized pieces. We both got a side of fries with freshly grated Parmesan. The perfect dish when a vegetarian is craving something savory. I'm looking forward to returning and trying something else from the menu so as to not miss out on another great meal. The server refilled our iced teas and cashed us out while chatting us up. One of the friendliest servers I've ever had (damn I wish I remembered his name). Note: they are a BYOB and have several locations around Philly. Collingswood is worth the extra mile though.",2017-08-30 01:40:47,-1.1267787,1.0747087,-0.5638882

The dining rooms are charming, the service is without parallel and the cuisine surpasses all of the above.  Dinner is a luxurious event here, so please plan to spend at least a couple of hours indulging the senses.  (Of course, if you have more pressing matters, the staff will see that you're in and out in good time.)  My husband had the Foie de Vignon (calves liver) last night and it was succulent perfection.  I tend to have a bunch of hors d'oeuvres (OMG, do they do gooood hors d'oeuvres!!!) and a salad.  Last night it was escargots, the Tres Champignons en Croute (three mushrooms in puff paste), and their special of the evening, a crab souffle ... I'm still dreaming of the crab souffle.  The salad I love was no longer on the menu, but our server, Monsieur Raymond, created one specially for me and it was superb.  Last, but not least, was their exquisite Grand Marnier souffle for dessert.  (The Four Seasons in NYC should take lessons from the chef at LRV for this delicacy.)  We consider ourselves ""foodies"" and I cook for us 9 nights out of 10 and enjoy it.  Le Rendezvous is an absolute pleasure which we thoroughly enjoy.

I've tried the fish tacos, fried fish, cerviche, shrimp relleno & shrimp culichi.  My favorites would have to be the Shrimp Culichi and the Shrimp Relleno.  The green sauce in the shrimp culichi is so creamy and flavorful.  I usually put my rice in it too because I want that flavor in every bite!  Super yummy and fulfillingly deliciious!  Oh, and as for the Shrimp Relleno....Giant sized Shrimp wrapped in bacon, what more could you ask for?  =) Both are served with fries and a salad too!  Mmmm, I think I'm getting hungry again!  Lol.  

My only caveat is the service.  I'd actually have to take a half star off, making it a 4.5 star rating, because of it.  Our waitress was a bit slow and inattentive.  We had to either try to make eye contact with her or flag her down to get refills on our drinks, and later when we wanted our check.  The bus boy actually was more helpful and friendly.  Anyways, other than that, the food outweighed the service in my book. (Probably cause this is one of the only seafood places in town that is worth going to, I'd overlook it!)

Pizza in Delaware County needs to be graded that way. If you don't feel like driving into the city to get a Gennaros Tomatoe Pie ,Beddia ,Nomad, SLiCe or any of the other pies that have elevated our pizza game in Philly, you need to temper your expectations when you stay locally. 

Double Decker supply's the Ridley Wrestling Boosters the slices they sell at each home match. Typical of most Booster slices, they are usually more to the colder side. It never tasted that bad so I thought I'd try a hot, fresh, out-of-the-oven pie at their beautiful new location in Media.

This spacious shop has two floors for you to eat your food, ice cold beer to drink there or take out and a large kitchen well staffed to handle your order. 

I tried the small personal pan size plain pie and the 5 hot buffalo wing sampler. Had a diet Dr Pepper to drink. 

The verdict? The pizza had a light crust although it was far from crispy. More to a thicker Greek crust of which I'm not a fan. The three cheeses were ok. The sauce tasted like it came out of a can.  The wings were ok. Not horrible. Not great. I wanted them to the well side but these didn't come that way. Included was three pieces of celery and ranch dressing.

As we strolled we listed off our choices trying to make the decision as we walked...East Girard Gastropub, Kraftwork, Frankford Hall, Interstate 295...all good places to which we have already been. But as we passed each one they all looked like sardine cans. Instead of sardines they were packed with humans. Humans that smelled worse than fish in a can. So, we kept on. 

Then we passed Lloyd and decided to give it a try. My girlfriend loves whiskey,  the menu looked interesting, and it was busy, but not filled to the gills. So, in we went. 
My immediate reaction to the decor/ambiance was that it felt like an upscale VFW. The bar is adorned with mismatched stuffed armchairs (cozy!) and fun vintage wall art that has a cabin in the woods and/or dark pool hall feel. There was something just a little off on the overall vibe. I got the sense that the owners had a limited budget to dedicate towards the design and decor. Maybe it was the startlingly white acoustical grid ceiling, or the Pergo floors that make that dreadful hollow knocking sounds when you walk across them, or maybe it was the off-the-shelf white folding residential closet door covering what I assume was a storage closet. This sounds overly nit-picky, but when I think ""whiskey bar"" I imagine a dark, dimly lit, cozy space with dark (real) wood accents and leather. Also, it lacked a good seating area adjacent to the bar. A overly wide space between the tables and bar felt like an unused dance floor. 

But enough about the design of the space. Now to the important part. The food.

I got suckered into some special cocktail that was made with a whiskey that aged for 6 months in some special aged oak barrel. It was yummy, but at $13 a pop - I didn't go for another round. For food bits we got roasted beets in a siracha honey glaze, chicken liver mousse pate with bread, and a mozzarella & prosciutto with broccoli rabe sandwich. I loved the beets and the chicken liver. The sandwich was  good, but basic. There wasn't a crumb left on any of the plates and the servings were pretty generous.  The two cocktails my ladyfriend had were also super yummy, and a much more reasonable $9 a piece.

Overall I enjoyed my experience. The service was very good, the food hit the spot. I would go back again to try their other offerings. I only dwell so long on the ambiance of the place because I think they have a good thing going, but in a town like Philly where there are so many good restaurants with great atmosphere and design, a restaurant has to do more than make good food to survive long term. I hope this place continues to do well. It's great having another quality place to go to in Fishtown.",2014-02-05 23:17:37,-0.7392676,-0.62623245,-0.8143939

I started with some of the hot food; noodles, teriyaki chicken, dumplings, and tempura.  The noodles were my least favourite so we tried the rice but it wasn't very good.  The tempura had a light batter and was delicious.  Next I tried the sashimi, sushi and cone.  The sashimi was fresh and yummy but I wasn't a fan of my cone.  Since there were 10 of us, we were able to share and try more of the hot food including the fish and tofu where were good.

For antojitos/appetizers: 

First, get the guacamole ($9). Someone will come by and mix & blend the ingredients from scratch into a delicious dip! 

The queso fundido ($9)---ok, it's simple in nature: melted cheese. But it is DELICIOUS! It is served with a side of warm, steamed tortillas. So good. 

The pulpo ($12)---light and delicious! Highly recommend it! 

Main entree: 

The salmon ($22). It is served with green fava beans and some bites of fried yuca, over a sea of some tasty, green sauce. The yuca was a tad salty but still great. The salmon was beautifully broiled and flavorful. Overall, a mouth-melting meal!

Molly and our friend from Chicago, down on business, ventured in last Monday night. We got a table in the smaller dining room. Molly had a bunless veggie burger and Hannah had the BBQ pulled pork with slaw. They both seemed to enjoy them. The pork was delicious. I had the brat burger with kraut and swiss on a pretzel bun! It was unbelievable! The brat flavor is something you really can't mess up too much, and this was not at all, especially on that awesome bun! We all had the asparagus as a side, which was delicious. I had a pumpkin beer, which is something I would probably actually die for. That good. Get one if you haven't had one. Preferably on tap. Hannah had a sampler and seemed to enjoy them all for the most, my heart got real warm in my chest when she listed the Pale Ale as one of her two favorites of the six. Some thing about that Pale Ale is just comforting. The wedding I went to this weekend had it as one of their bottle choices. I am determined to have a keg of it at mine.

I moved in my apartment smelled very bad ( they had an odor system connected to get rid of it) When I walked in with the leasing agent I noticed scratches on the hardwood floor, stains on the kitchen cooktop, walls had scratches, etc. I wrote all this down on the new tenant walk thru paper work, and it got signed by the leasing agent. 
 I had to submit a few work orders to get most of it done. I am pretty easy going person so I went ahead and did it. I was happy to be in my new apartment. I really never had any issues so I never required the office attention. I had a few  issues, like the light bolts dying on me, roaches, and they took care of it.
I am pretty easy going, but when I moved in, I went and clean my apartment, and left everything spotless (I had pictures to prove it as well).  A few days later I get an invoice. 
I am being charge for the cooktop and scratches on the hardwood floor (WHICH I NOTATED ON MY WALK THRU PAPER WORK) (WHICH I STILL HAD). 
Since I work a lot I sent my mother to talk to the property manager XHEVAIRE McCool.  My mother is the most educated person I met. She grew up in the Catholic church so she is very respectful and proper with everyone, even rude people such as the manager.  The manager barely paid any attention to her, when my mother asked for a copy of the walk thru paper the manager said she was missing page 1 (I know right). To our advantage, I always file all the important paper work, so I had a signed copy myself. She bought that with her. The manager said she will contact her corporate office so Chelsea (corporate agent who was very nice and professional fix it).  
The main reason I am writing this review is because the lack of professionalism.  How did they loose page 1 of the walk thru?  Don't they usually keep a file with all that information.  Also why will they try to charge me for something that was clearly marked on the walk thru paper work. 
Come on they knew that was there. On top of that I had proof that it was there when I moved in. 
When I spoke to Chelsea at the corporate office she indeed made it better, and fixed it to the best of her abilities and I am grateful for that, but I still cant recommend that place.   I don't appreciate the fact that the office people are so helpless specially the manager. 

If you are to move there please make sure you use a magnifier and check every area of the apartment, including the floor. Make sure you write down every scratch, every paint missing, or issue. I am very glad I did or I had to pay my $300 deposit and $592 on top of that for the scratches on the floor and cooktop damage that was already there when I got the apartment.

I do want to thank Chelsea at the corporate office for all her help. She was very knowledgeable of her job and she helped me out as much as she could. She understood why I was upset about the fact that the manager was trying to rip me off and charge me for damage I did not caused. I greatly appreciate that.

I've been enjoying it for a little over a month now, I was able to join because of a LivingSocial deal which reduced the normal monthly fee of $102 to $60 (and no initiation charge and a massage or personal training session, to boot!). This now stands as the best LivingSocial deal ever in the history of the universe and it shall never be surpassed. Fin. 

I find most gyms utilitarian. Some are nicer than others, some have more equipment or shorter wait times for machines or cleaner facilities, but generally the vibe is people are there to work out and you go in and get it done and go home. The atmosphere here is totally different. The whole place just seems designed to make you feel taken care of. On the first floor, there is a small cafe with very friendly staff, I like to stop there for a quick snack and some coffee after an early-morning workout. There are some armchairs in front of a flat-screen TV that's usually tuned to CNN, some longer tables where you could eat lunch, and a few smaller tables by the windows overlooking Broad Street that have a great view. I've been to other gyms that have juice bars/cafes, but this one just has a very pleasant, friendly vibe to it. 

The locker rooms are great. They're never crowded, the lockers are big enough to fit whatever you've brought with you. They have absolutely every amenity you could want - for the showers, there are shower caps, razors, body wash, shampoo/conditioner, and shaving cream. The towels are fluffy and always plentiful. There are individual vanities stocked with deodorant, hairspray, body lotion, hairdryers (with diffusers!) and curling irons. Whatever you need, they have it here. I don't think I've showered at home since becoming a member. 

Since it's been approximately 1 million degrees throughout my membership, I've been using the pool rather than the other fitness facilities. It is absolutely lovely. It is occasionally crowded enough that I've had to share a lane, but everyone is very friendly about it. Only once have I ever had to actually wait for a lane, and that was literally for five minutes. After my swims, I like to indulge in a soak in the giant hot tub, which is the size of my living room at home. I am not kidding. There is also a sauna. The hot tubs and saunas are single-sex, while the pool is co-ed. I'm a fan of the setup. 

As others have mentioned, if the Sporting Club has an achilles heel, it is the price. I believe the normal initiation fee is $450, on top of the $102 monthly membership fee. They were recently running a promotion for a $99 initiation fee, but you're still looking at a considerable amount of outlay for a gym membership. If you can find a way to fit it into your budget, it would absolutely be worth it. After my promotion ends, I'll be wistfully looking forward to the day my life allows me to return!",2011-07-31 02:12:41,-1.2435155,0.6354639,-0.36898357

Yes it's a chain restaurant, but if you're craving a burrito and you're in the Metairie, LA area; then this would be a solid choice.  There are three sized burritos and for lack of my ability to remember what they were actually called, I'll simply refer to them as small, medium and large.  I am a big eater (really big) and the medium had me so full from lunch, that it affected my ability to eat a full dinner some 4-5 hours later.

When you walk up to order your food, there are three (life sized) burritos on the wall to help you decide what size to order.  There were several different tortillas to choose from including, corn, flour, wheat, tomato, spinach and pepper.  Next you simply choose your meat (chicken, ground beef, flat iron steak, pork) your bean type (refried, pinto or black) and then top it off with all the fixins'.  If you are a vegan, you can go for a meatless option.  There are also other dishes on the menu, but when you're in a burrito joint, I'd stick with the burrito.

The combo burrito will get you chips and a drink, and you can choose between salsa or queso for you chips; which were unbelievably fresh, as if they were just deep fried on site.  Cost for a small and medium combination was approximately $24.00, which I feel is a little steep for ""fast food"", but the flavors were good and the quantity was excellent.

Overall, this was a good experience.  The food was hot and fresh, the restaurant was clean, cool and well designed and the service was quick.",2013-06-07 21:29:32,0.36523518,-0.9245157,-0.48864156

Since I knew I didn't have the time to hit up another truck I decided to try two of the menu items and went for the Bulgogi taco and the fried kimchi rice balls. I added the pineapple habanero sauce and Gochujang to both. Let's start with the taco. It came with the beef and the red cabbage slaw. Even with the two sauces, for whatever reason the flavors just didn't mesh to me. Towards the end, a piece of the bulgogi did fall out and I sampled it by itself. It was a tasty little piece of meat. I think I would have been happy with a chunk of that and some of the pineapple habanero sauce. As forewarned, both sauces did have a nice little kick to them. The rice balls were just okay. I was expecting them have a little more flavor on their own but they were fairly bland. I could kind of taste the cheese but I was expecting a little more of a meltiness to the dish that just wasn't there. I'm not sure what kind of cheese it was...maybe it wasn't supposed to get melty? I added a little extra of the pineapple sauce and I enjoyed it a little more. The kimchi rice balls came with two balls and the the taco was one per order.

While Indianapolis is a relatively old Midwestern city, the IMA's history is recent; it was known as the ""Art Association"" until 1969.

The recent multi-year renovation, redevelopment and expansion of the Museum and grounds created an entirely new experience for art patrons.  Let's all say our condolences to the Krannert Pavilion's Brutalist architecture of the 1970s and hello to a somewhat uninspired series of camera-ready atria that will no doubt allow some very impressive parties.

The collection itself is conservative and unprovoking.  Highlights include Robert Indiana's iconic masterwork (and trademark-infringed) ""LOVE"" painting and sculpture, a beautifully painted though incredibly ill-placed Rembrandt, a decent Hopper, an encyclopedic Asian art collection that is one of the best in the country, and the largest collection of JMW Turner drawings outside of Great Britain (although quantity does not trump quality).

I thought the gift shop was as poorly stocked as the previous one.  Not a single postcard of the new museum's exterior, yet there were plenty of old postcards showing the now-demolished Krannert Pavilion.  And for an artwork that's been copied, dubiously appropriated and downright stolen, why was there not one postcard available of Robert Indiana's outdoor ""LOVE"" sculpture?  And what about museum merchandise based off its own artwork: scarves with motif from the museum's Tiffany piece, jewelry pieces mimicking something from the Asian galleries or pop-up note cards laser-cut with the new museum facade?  Sure, all the ""LOVE"" stuff is nice, but capitalize on other museum strengths.

This is a wonderful museum that has a decent collection.  The parking is free, the new eating options are terrific, and there are other fun attractions on the museum grounds, most notably the Lilly estate, Oldfields.",2007-12-12 09:15:32,-1.6881632,0.30980834,0.3935188

The food that I had at dinner was okay (pretty good sushi for the price). What wasn't fine was the way that I was treated when I called back the next morning (I'll explain). After leaving the restaurant the night before, I realized that I had accidentally left a large amount of cash on the table (not talking about the $6 cash tip I had also left for my $27 meal) before walking out and wasn't able to go back to retrieve it because I had left the restaurant at closing time. I called them back the next day as soon as they opened up and explained to them what had happened. While a very small part of me was hoping that I'd be able to get my money back, as it was pretty obvious that I had dropped it on the table by accident (I had set aside my cash tip with my receipt, so that extra cash wad was obviously not supposed to be there), I really just wanted them to at least speak nicely to me on the phone. However, I was met with a lot of confusion/disbelief by the man that I was talking to on the phone and eventually told to ""hold on."" The man went on to have multiple conversations with employees at the restaurant while I was still on the phone (no, I wasn't put on hold). Eventually, he came back on the phone call and told me that he had just asked all of the servers who were there the night before if they had picked up the amount of cash I had lost, but everyone had claimed not to. I nicely told the man on the phone that I had a feeling that my server was not telling the truth and most likely pocketed the money instead of splitting the tips with the rest of the servers (as they do at Crazy Sushi), because I remembered leaving the money on the table. Again, I was met with disbelief and an accusatory tone, then told to hold again. Like last time, I wasn't put on hold, and heard him and a woman screaming back and forth at each other, presumably about me. At that point, I was 100% sure that the man either knew that my server was lying about taking the money or that the money had been split amongst the servers at the end of the night. He eventually came back on the phone to tell me that he asked the servers again (which he couldn't have done since he was yelling the whole time) and they all claimed not to have picked up the money. 

Long story short, I simply wanted someone to be nice to me on the phone, regardless of the outcome -- it would have been nice to have received a simple apology for the possibility of my server picking up the money and pocketing it, as I knew that the money was probably long gone at that point.

Context:
It was our Golden Anniversary last night, 6 years on the 6th... We had just briefly met Exec. Chef Casey Frank at an event this last Thursday, and decided to celebrate at Livery as we'd been meaning to stop by for awhile now. It seems he must have 1.) seen us come in; 2.) recognized who we were from the event; and 3.) remembered we had mentioned it was our anniversary that night - because after we placed our order of a salad and two entrees, the server came back out and informed us we should ""...forget about your order"" and wait for the experience Chef had lined up for us... 
What followed was an astounding 8-course small plate journey, with some of the most delicious and memorable flavor profiles we've encountered in Indianapolis. Chef Casey came out on two occasions to chat with us about the food and make sure we were having a good time. We felt like nothing short of royalty at 6:30pm on a Sunday. 

Food: (I'll highlight just a few dishes so as not to write a novel) 
Sweet Plantains were culinary genius. Sweetness of the plantain, saltiness of black bean puree, spice from the habanero guajillo sauce, and brininess of the pickled onion in the pineapple salsa were perfectly balanced. The combinations were so complex, but you could still individually identify each component and the role they played in the dish. 
Pork Tenderloin could be cut with a fork and was full of flavor. Slight char on the outside gave it smoke, which was complemented by an incredible sweet corn puree and spicy serrano hot sauce. 
Scallop was the most well-prepared I've had in a long time. Perfect golden-brown sear on the outside, and so tender with not one bite of grit... A feat that, in my book, is quite an accomplishment! Served with a roasted carrot and poblano pico garnish, it was another masterful balance of sweet and heat while letting the seafood shine.
Churros were a playful and well-executed nod to Latin street fare. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a wonderful caramel sauce that was obviously made in-house. 

Service:
Our server Tommy was a delight, from the first moment when he brought us 2 complimentary champagnes to toast. Friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive, he engaged my wife and I just enough to provide quality service and make sure everything was in order, while giving us privacy to enjoy each other's company. We very much enjoyed his service!

I honestly don't know what we did to deserve such a gift, but sincere and heartfelt thanks - To Chef Casey, Tommy, and Livery - for making our Golden Anniversary so very special. My only regret is not taking pictures before devouring every bite! We will certainly be coming back, and are adamant about spreading the word on this gem of an Indy restaurant.",2017-08-08 01:14:36,-0.83352125,-0.32191437,-0.011237529

I appreciated that their baked goods were clearly marked if they are gluten free. I loved the lemon bar, it was not too crumbly and the perfect amount of tartness. I highly recommend the avocado toast with the poached egg. They make their bread in house. The egg was cooked perfectly so that It was not running all over the place.

The first time I went it was just after 9, and there was only a limited late night menu available. I understand the late night idea, but there was no mention of this on the website, and since I was looking forward to really exploring the menu I decided to wait. 

The second time I returned was around 3pm on a Sunday, which they close at 3. Odd hours, but they are listed on their site, chalk it up to my not paying attention.

The third time was around 8 pm on a weeknight, and we were seated right next to the kitchen although there were several open tables. I went with a buddy of mine, and we weren't wearing nice jeans and button downs, I felt like if we had we would have received a better table. After ordering two apps and two entrees, the waitress asked why I didn't want to be more adventurous (I ordered a carne asada taco and a carnitas taco). I was kind of offended, if I wanted to be more ""adventurous"" I would have been, with or without your suggestion, and certainly not after the question was phrased very pretentiously. If you can make great carne asada and carnitas tacos, I would be totally ok with returning and trying the lengua. 
Chips and salse were brought prior to the appetizers, there were two salsas and they were both good. Keep in mind we were two hungry guys, and when we asked for more chips the response verbally was yes, but body language and tone was ""oh great, these guys just want to fill up on chips and salsa."" The appetizers arrived and the Queso Fundido was great, the tortillas served on the side were also very good. The Guacamole was bland, and a really a small portion, that was also served with the same salsas that came complimentary, do yourself a favor and just skip this, I feel like I paid too much for half of a mashed up avocado, and again the salsas were the stars.
When the entrees arrived the tacos were great, the sides were really disappointing. They had almost no flavor, and after salting them they just tasted like salt. So you're paying $6/taco, and they were good, but there are plenty of taco stands that offer the same quality. 
So we were kinda disappointed, and I guess you could tell because when the manager walked by and asked how everything was (knowing well that as a new business, the feedback is vital to moving forward and correcting any mistakes) I mentioned that the food was bland, but also what I did like. The response was ""OK, I guess I need to try that then."" To sum it all up, service was mediocre at best, and the food was good at points and then also pretty bad at points.

The menu is slightly overwhelming, so I defaulted to the original hummus and green salad. The original hummus is soft and nutty just like Zahav/Dizengoff (sorry to pull so many restaurants into this, but I think alluding to them shows the high standard of quality Suraya meets). I blame that on the tehina, Soom Foods. It is served with a pita, fresh from the oven, and it's soft and airy with a subtle crust. The green salad included gem lettuce, raw fennel, watermelon radishes, a soft-boiled egg, yogurt dressing, and pita chips. The flavor profile was satisfying. The meal overall was light, filling, and nourishing! 

I went back for seconds the week after. Opted for the baba ganoush, pita, and the rest of the party got the gravlax. Overall, everyone was satisfied. While the ganoush was tasty, I think I'll stick to the hummus. I appreciate that particular spread much more.

Our reservation was at 9:15, but the people at our table were taking their sweet time in leaving, so we had a drink at the bar -- the bartender was so much fun!  I normally just have gin & soda or a martini, but the cocktail menu was inviting -- not too much crap in the drinks, nothing sweet -- so I got the thing with gin and aperol.  It was really refreshing, but - as a guy - I was a little embarrassed by the rose petals on the top.

Anyway, we sat down around 9:30.  We didn't experience any of the service problems mentioned by other reviewers (and LaBan), but it was also later on in the evening, so who knows.  In any event, our servers were prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable.  I was a little annoyed, though, that no one came around with a crumb scraper.

So, the menu: prix fixe four courses, with five or six choices per course for $45 (+$30 for wine pairing), or prix fixe six course chef's tasting for $65 (+something for wine pairing).  The six courses that day were fish heavy, and didn't suit everyone at the table, so we didn't go for that.

I started with the (legendary?) foie gras soup -- it was great!  Creamy, but not heavy, with subtle flavors of the foie gras, lemongrass, and a little heat from chili peppers.  The soup was well paired with a sparkling rosé.

For the fish course, I had the black cod with miso glaze and kimchee.  The fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the addition of apple slices to the kimchee was amazing.  The fish was paired with a Falanghina, which was ok, but didn't do it for me.

The meat course I chose was the lamb chop.  The chop was beautifully cooked, and was tender, juicy, and extremely flavorful.  This was paired with oatmeal (which the server addressed, and assured me it was cooked with lamb stock and tasted like a risotto) and pork belly.  Neither the oatmeal nor the pork belly had ANY flavor.  The consistency of the oatmeal did add something, but otherwise, I think the lamb could have been paired with something better.  I don't remember the wine this dish was paired with, but I remember it being just ok.

I had the mascarpone with coffee granita for dessert -- it was good, and was paired with a nice port.  I tasted someone else's hot chocolate mousse, though, and was really jealous.  The mousse was phenomenal, and I highly recommend it.

All in all, I highly recommend this place, and will definitely be back.  I think next time, though, I will choose my own wine.",2012-03-03 17:29:02,0.42843303,-0.6178978,-1.3939238

The service was excellent, particularly the wine service. 

The food, on the other hand, was uneven. The scallop and the gnocchi dishes were incredible, but the other dishes - wild boar pasta, roast, some awful bone marrow dish my friend received, and the desserts were not good enough to warrant the price tag. Moreover, I felt like each dish was heavier than the next. I wish the menu was better balanced with a few more dishes that had a lighter touch. After the scallops, it was all meat, pasta and heavy sauces. 

Finally, I was with two friends and I hated that we each received something different at each course and we had no input on who received what. I understand respectingt eh vision of the chef, but what about serving the tastes of the customers?  

I go to a lot of high end restaurants and a lot of multi course dinners. I'm not uncomfortable spending well over $150 for a meal, BUT, I also expect a meal in this price range to be amazing and I was far from amazed at Vetri.

Certainly nothing worth writing home about. Drinks, as others have mentioned, are overpriced and not delicious.

I came looking to try a Sazerac in New Orleans, but wasn't near fancy enough to go to The Sazerac Bar. You could practically see the bartender's eye twitch as I walked in with running shorts, a tank top, and a backpack, but luckily being right off Bourbon St. I'm far from the taboo end of the quirky character spectrum. (Sorry! I promise if there's a next time I'll dress appropriately.) So as I sat down to the snazzy beats of the vintage-inspired band Albanie Falletta and The Southern Gentlemen, I fixated on Mac's ($12) Sazerac. 

You have several good options upon ordering a drink. A) Watch the old (yes, black and white) film being played behind the bar. It's on mute, but subtitles are on! B) Watch the bartender make your drink (bonus points if he/she's doing two cocktails at once). C) Watch the band play and bob your head like a cool cat. The bartenders are good at what they do, and they even make their own fruit infused vodka! The artist line-up can be found at http://www.21stamendmentlalouisiane.com/calendar/2015/05/ , and I really enjoyed the lively string set by Albanie and the Gentlemen. Way better than the off-key ruckus going on at Wednesdays at the (Lafeyette) Park. And the setting is much more intimate. In fact I'd say less than 20 people could fit in here comfortably at the bar and high cocktail tables. 

I was tempted to try more of their signature cocktails, but dinner was calling and the band went on break. Also, there was the fact that I didn't feel like dropping another $10 on a drink.

I was pleasantly surprised.  

The popcorn chicken was a little heavy handed with the black pepper but it was fried perfectly, not greasy at all, and really tasty.  

The chicken basil dish reminded me of home cooked meals by my dad when I was younger.  Tiny bone in portions of chicken with a nice sauce and yummy basil leaves, garlic and slices of ginger.  

The scallion pancakes were also good but I can get the same thing out of the freezer section at an Asian grocery store.  But the sauce they comes with the pancakes - DELICIOUS!  If they got said sauce from a bottle, please let me know what it's called and where I can find it!

The braised beef noodle soup was nice.  The broth was a little lacking in flavor but nothing I can't fix.  The noodles would have been better if they used fresh egg noodles in lieu of the linguini type noodle they use but it's just a personal preference.  The beef was tender and easily fell apart, definitely a must order especially when it's cold and rainy outside.

The oyster pancake was not our favorite.  I'm used to the one my dad made at home and it's a lot crispier than 101's.  This dish came out extremely wet and gelatinous and I couldn't swallow it down without thinking about something gross.

The service was really friendly.  It's a shame that 101's got some bad reviews in reference to service and I'm glad that I didn't have to experience that this trip.

I tried one or two salons in the area before I found these guys and I am so glad that I found them. BTW I am a very very picky person when it comes to nail salons for multiple reasons. 
number 1 reason being hygiene- this place is always so clean. They open a fresh pack of tools each time for each individual which according to me is top of the  list. 
number 2 reason being they do such a wonderful work. I mean each person at this place is so  good at what they do.
number 3 reason - I could rank this number 1 as well - these people are so polite and so nice. For me getting a mani pedi is like relaxing and winding down so being around happy and sweet faces makes it even more relaxing. 
number 4 - their prices are pretty reasonable too. Even if they were not, I would still go only here in Sanit louis.
